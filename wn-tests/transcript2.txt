the double salty forward Pikes and you know what I did this summer I pulled my
back out putting on
look at
her she was right it
was such an honor and I'm going to show you what happened later in
all right so here's here's what I want to talk about today I'll
I go there to just kind of
chill and unwind and however last week was not so relaxing we're walking around and all
so I knew it wasn't our dog and I knew it wasn't anything else
delicious and so and
worse thing so here's what they say this is a sign
from a hiking trail near our house and I want to share it
another college senior she
my resume I have the directions where I'm going where am I missing
the cat that's how big is this is right there medium sized cat you know what they say and
first date you ask a lot of questions you listen to each other in the things go really
but you know it here's the thing I think it's important to be healthy I tried to be healthy
and live a
healthy lifestyle I eat well and exercise sometimes I'll take the stairs instead of
King I don't know if you've heard about this yet but this is not making this up this
is absolutely true look at the
know what I say to that Mountain Dew not currently
the new chef at Taco Bell is
Honey Boo Boo child all right
I'm done ranting and raving about fast food restaurants one more
thing about Chick-fil-A
Desert how many of you ate too much over the holidays and
the rest of you are liars if you didn't oh
it I don't care I don't care I was just shoving food things
that they say that you have to wait 15 minutes before or after eating before you
gas station there was a whole area
at the seventh day of our 12 days of giveaways you
you have is these two can
we have to
and give you some Pringles
Boss sorry
I just went and then I know it's not the way it's going
first of all I think we are all glad that we won't be seeing any more election ads I
I never thought I'd
and despite our differences
hate that so whoever
it's a curse I
close it never is you
thought you'd agree they shouldn't be able to charge you for something that
they leave laying around like it's a gift the last
to stay in the resort when
to the wall melt the ice down she got yourself a bucket of free water anyway
anyway I'm happy to
last year my resolution was to stop procrastinating and I still haven't gotten around to it so I'm
keep America busy
like where are your pants what trying to figure out why there's a banjo in
bed with you you're covered in Cool Whip hey
by anyway hypothetical I was just wondering I was curious what kind of
resolutions that people made this year so I asked my Facebook fans and here
don't know if you
read these cheese I can't even keep up
with my own Facebook and I'm not famous well
Eldridge says my resolution is to quit men summer
I'm assuming I'm passing out and I'm happy to say my jet lag is gone it's gone
to hell I
to feel better Saturday morning and then this is so cool Saturday afternoon my
back went out yeah but that hour and a half
in between was so good I felt so good I can't believe I did
stupid like that you know I moved to sofa or a chair or something like that
think I'm fine cuz my back's fine and then I lift something heavy and when you
hear the story you'll understand why I move the table I was trying to be helpful and there
movers coming to pick up
that my back is made out of rice noodles it has been a frustrating few weeks
going around then we went to Australia then I
literally I was walking like this one six inches
offered Porsche and apple and she ran away crying so
the chiropractor came
do I drive myself I mean my assistant carries
me to my car once I'm in like to
drive I actually loved driving
because when I loved I drive in the morning it's it's really my me time you know and I
guess doing an hour of The Ellen Degeneres Show could be considered me time also but my
real me
time is actually after work when I'm relaxing at home and then there's my meat I'm sitting in
a bubble bath with a glass of wine most of my day is meat
I'm really when I think about it but my
first me time is is
when I'm driving to work in the morning and I
drive fast I love to drive fast that's why I married to Portia and I
love driving fast and I don't know why there's one Fastlane my my preference would
be there be fast faster and
to become their mother like
watching them in the rear view mirror the whole time why they
were going fast enough Missy no one's having a baby Kim
Kardashian is but that's not the point so anyway
I don't let Tailgaters pass because if they're keeping up with
me they're going way over the
speed limit anyway and we're sharing the road and I'm a safe driver but I
I think if you're a fast driver or as I call us normal
doesn't realize that you can easily take a turn at 35 miles
per hour if you lean into it and
that his wife for her 40th birthday I'm getting her one of those driver instructor cars
so she can drive but I'll have the pedals on my side again it's not a control issue
all right I'm going to start today show with an important question has anyone been to a store lately
then you'll
this drug store and I'm not going to say which one was the CVS and she
bought three things which I'm not going to tell you cuz they were personal was batteries
this item also bought this you've seen that right like people who bought
Golden Girls season 1 also bought a taser what most
people wear that's looking to buy a Taser other people get out by a taser I don't know suggesting
things for me either they don't know me they
needing where there is JCPenney I forgot I
don't know who's in charge of receipts I'm
just saying they shouldn't be as long as a roll of
toilet paper that's my
opinion tune in tomorrow when
again it's the
mean so be open to love all year stay positive and if nothing else
so I got dressed and I
left the house and I started driving to work and there was someone in front
of me driving so slowly like
you know cuz that would be horrible to
baby parakeet in there anyway so I'm driving to
studio there's a Vans here's
questions about it first of all I hope it's an advertisement I pray it's
not a van full of topless maid stuck in there like that's the phone number you call to
parked outside my house you know I don't want that parked outside my house mostly I want to
Brothers lot looking for a topless maid besides Tony I'm
but things are always going to be changing and instead of
getting frustrated by how the new Facebook layout is I have a few suggestions on how you can deal
let's talk about the Super Bowl I know I know it's Tuesday and we should be done with that
was a everybody knows but if you lived under a rock for the
last 34 minutes
minutes blackout in the
what year was wondering
our Valentine's Day show because my producer Matt Wright comes in wearing a red sweater
years mostly from watching The Bachelor but I know that love is everywhere I actually I do I
think love is everywhere I think you just have to really notice it
write some beautiful meaningful love note you
have to find a special gift or if you're a man you buy flowers on the freeway off-ramp actually
it's a shame that Valentine's Day
a long time over there all of the country there were a lot of important issues
to draw that's
a very happy to say there's now a record number of women in the Senate there are 19
women in the Senate what
what is 19 out
is 19 out of a hundred I'm not sure what the percentage of that anyway
to at least a binder full
of women that's now
that we have more women in the Senate I think
obviously with more women in the government they'll pretty much
I think we're going to have a female
president someday right that is why today I'm announcing that in 2016 I will be running to
the polls hopefully to vote for
a female president you heard it here first actually
boy that's a lot of energy will have I was watching you out here you're holding
yourselves and who was
that you were holding yourself but really there's a lot of great energy here how
up black coffee or a rooster those are the two ways I guess you can
choose the size of the sand the sweetener in the temperature in the flavor in
the tent in the color in the cup holders the power steering and anti-lock brakes
just get the Norah Jones CD and that's all
have express lanes mr. Starbucks
if you're listening you should put in express lanes
for people who can order in 10 words or less and
today is a special day because today we're going to talk about our feelings some
some people got uncomfortable
people got uncomfortable that's weird the reason we're going
is the time for experimenting and here is what they did they had
people react to different situations and then they took pictures of the people's faces so these
pictures weren't selfies they were someone else sees and based on the people's facial expressions they identified
and then I realize we didn't really need scientist to tell us that I've seen people display all of
me I'm
is a number and here's what I have come to
realize that as I become wiser and tiny bit older certain things
start happening that make you realize that
a it's just not silent anymore
starts slowly you buy a pair of Easy Spirits
and doing anything for money or you can watch Breaking Bad fans
going to be up TiVo now cuz now we don't have to choose between one chore another
it could be Friday or Saturday to be Sunday could be June I don't know what had
watch shows is the new way to watch TV because a lot of shows release the
entire season at once and that anybody been to watching the house of cards that Netflix series
along and you can watch your favorite shows and gold rush home but if you were relating you
miss 5 minutes the first 5 minutes you never say
thing in the world to talk about money I
to deposit the check right away but that second
app on your phone that doesn't involve sexting we
the nice thing about all this kind of technology is it makes life so so much easier it gives
weird laugh or they were a man I always have but finding find
later you get a list of potential matches romantic it
yet you're here thank you I
we've got to stop these people that are texting while they're driving this has to stop and it is
called truck stops I used to call him home that's another story for another
really don't try it I know
it's tempting to check your messages while you're driving you think what if it's important but trust
me it's never important never it it's either a question about dinner or it's something filthy we
that we have to offer people money to turn their phones off to actually talk to
you anywhere. Next question. How many do you like to drink how
many of you already started drinking really a
thing all
what took so long
took so long for
that to happen that's really a great idea
then you can drink and shop at the
same time but some stores are
canister something then once
bad on the mannequin you know why cuz their arms don't been so
also plenty of reasons why drunk shopping could be bad thing about your life how many of you
have made good decisions while you're drunk you get drunk you end up texting you
I ever put my
tire with chains and
but I don't want
I don't want to talk about politics today cuz
anyone else relate to the fear of balsamic vinegar the
dressing and I
it I mean you may call it salad dressing but I call
it the devil's condiment is what I call it everyone
without knocking we never do it again it always surprises me when
people are scared of I know people you know they have
like just relax and enjoy Stranger in
front of me at Starbucks The Lacs but

but it turned out to be everything it was
actually I brought someone
I brought someone here to help me explain sexy and and
and funny and please welcome Victoria's Secret supermodel Miranda Kerr
to tell you it's not that big of a deal but the other day
that's never trust
I think it is good for you to have that
Sharpie in a ball of yarn and a Red Bull at the same time if you're
where that's the day that we're going to give for the
beginning of rock and roll. As we continue into the core still see
the exactly fixing an exact date is pretty tough to do but let's say it's 1955 what was
music so mainstream pop music was
mostly purchased and consumed by the average middle-class
white consumer
rhythm and
blues with startup s music for
mostly urban African American consumers and
country western music was thought of as music for mostly rural white a
farming Community said this
kind of thing and so I thought it was three separate
markets even though stylistically are there were some real differences in the way we'll proceed is this
then the development of rhythm and blues in this.
Before 1955 so let's Dive
Right In with mainstream pop hear one of the first
things we have to understand about popular music before rock and roll is
the song is the primary think
not any particular performance of the
basic idea
if you were in the music business was to
write songs to publish song and
try to get as many different people to sing those songs as possible
Frank Zappa from the way we think
about rock and roll today right or the way we think about it even
in the 60s who wants a version of Sergeant Pepper that
isn't done by The Beatles who wants a First Sergeant Pepper that isn't the
this before 1955 was really driven
by music Publishers music Publishers job that we're
they sold these songs was
through sheet music and this business is
go Guitar Center you see
could play their home and back in those days a
author multiple members
of the family and so that you would
go up to the local five-and-dime and you would pick
out the song that you wanted to buy that
week or maybe a couple of songs they sold so
much sheet music that they are stores actually had resident a
bought it this is how important to sheet music business was it so people would
take this music back to the home and they
would perform it themselves into
and 1930s people had recordings and recordings of course we're importing something but you probably didn't have as many
so that rock and roll upset when it became so popular
in 1955 we have to
remember when
kinds of jobs a songwriter with somebody who
wrote a song and that
was wrote song that's what they did
they didn't particularly perform them they didn't
even have to have great piano skills or great singing
voices but they had to be able to write the songs they would turn out
song after song after song Sometimes in a formula kind of
way but also sometimes an extremely interesting
letters from the American Songbook wrote fantastic and and and very very clever and interesting and
sophisticated kind of sense but that was their job there is no recording of Cole Porter
sings the music of Cole Porter it was really not expected to the song lyrics should
song stylist so the way it would work is that a song would become popular in the in the
culture at people we hear the song various
kinds Waze we'll talk about that in just a minute and then these performers was
trying to put their own special
Marukai she might hear a song Let's thing from a little bit later. Something like my way or New
there was a song
was a song with one entity and the performance of it was another entity in these people specialize this
is something that we
see change in the history of
rock music where the the the model starts to be for about
the mid-60s that the people who write the
songs are the same people who performed the songs so the idea of a cover version say in
sauce how do they get to know about them that's what we'll deal with next
group or doo-wop group is kind of a social club and you
would format with with kids who lived right on
the same block as you and you will work up Arrangement and then kids from these different blocks would
were kept is Arrangements but
they had one worked up that was really kind of
talent for these R&B Indie labels producers would
that after they is there best number to do
this recording it was very difficult for them to follow up with the second
groups that had one big head and then
maybe a second one that wasn't as good a third one that had it at that
singers to vocalize without specific
be that slow number and so
were so lost will say one thing and then a group
a traditional conflict between the music of the church the gospel music which is considered God's
music and the
music of the club the rhythm and
blues music that that would be played in bars in the evenings, which was considered the
devil's music now this may seem simple-minded the
they probably should give this music up and turn their musical talents
at War praise in in in toward
the church and so this also happened with
more things are crossing over a lot more singers
are tempted some R&B artist even recast gospel numbers
one of the most controversial or we might say in certain sense dangerous at least to White audiences elements
a shocking kind of way and Rhythm blues music Blues tradition it's not
limited to black stars versus big
misconception that Hokum
Blues has the property of of the black community
in it and and for people who have
old racist views that it
playful type of
saw that humorous kind of song meant for adult audiences not
for teenagers and so
in an adult audience to playfully through
the use of double entendre in metaphors talk
about sexuality sexual relationships
and activity between a man
and a woman in a way that plays with
idea of the thing without ever actually saying it
in a raw or vulgar way continuing to work with metaphors and
double on Congress and where's that are clever
makes it fun and that's what the Holcomb Blues is about most white parents who
concerned with deflowering virginal white women and
so when you hear a black man singing a song about sexuality and
you are a white person with doesn't understand very much about Black Culture hearing this
there was a real reaction against these kinds of
tunes now to be
fair some of the titles were pretty
obvious pretty obvious what
out what these Tunes are going to be about what white artist did Welcome Blues
would get big on the charts that the R&B charts and
references are replaced with references to dancing and so in many
ways sextus sublimated into dancing and
so the songs become squeaky-clean inoffensive and acceptable to everybody and just about good clean teenage white
middle-class fun so even a song like Shake Rattle and Roll originally done
hits on the R&B charts had to have the lyrics changed significantly before they had any chance
of landing on the mainstream pop chart the black artists
that were involved in this didn't like this idea at all and
saw it is just another way in which black people were
being discriminated against and
of rock and
1955 that was mainstream pop country
and western and rhythm and blues we went through each of
those those the history of each of those Styles I bet take to get a
sense of what was going on leading up to 1955 we also raised the question why is
from the styles that came before and I'll
give the story away a little bit by saying one of the main ideas that's
often topped with regard
to the beginning of rock and roll is that rock and roll constitutes the blending of country and
western and rhythm and blues with mainstream pop
so it's a blend of those three with a with a some gospel thrown in on
the side and some doo-wop as
well that really create what rock
and roll is what I will say is that rock and roll happens when these
Styles become mainstream pop styles that is some rhythm and blues and country and
a with a talking a little bit about the entire of flow of
what will say this week about that the chi the. From
1955 to 1959 is
considered the first wave
take a minute to point
out that what you're learning in the
Coursera course it we're doing here is really
an American perspective on the history of rock music it's the way it
looks the way this history looks in the
United States will find out especially when we start to talk about the Beatles in
with regard to that well let's not
talk about dig dig
into this idea of the the rise of youth culture in the 1950s and talk about the invention
of separate entity in the culture so kind
have all kinds of things that were exclusive to that this was
and Sidney portier is about some
of 1955 and
1955 that we really start to see songs
course records of follow and in many of R&B
in the in the United States in the 1950s and
that white teenagers actually got to hear resume why not
which R&B came to young white teenagers that it wasn't it wasn't my
intention nobody who was doing R&B at that time was trying to
going to be the next big thing meaning of Fairly develop
regionally and soak station started to look at their region think
about opportunities for advertising it
before that assumed that
the music was live so if you were playing Corning it's like
you were trying to trick The
you played records instead of live music but with the rise of the disc jockey
records were
of which records day would play which gave gave the disk jockey certain amount of
power some people would think it gave him a bill that they built especially in a
that in 1947 for example that are about 3,000 disc
jockeys in this country a handful of them or black
stations playing music at the African-American listeners are some of the important R&B stations
a whbq Which Wich in 1949 launch Dewey Phillips is show Red Hot &
Blue in Memphis Dewey Phillips turns out
Elvis Presley by playing his first record on it his first son a recording that's alright Mama Elsa Jean
Nobles John Rick
Morgan Haas Alan at WLAC in Nashville daddy Sears at
w g St in Atlanta and Hunter Hancock was a
black DJ NK at
kfbd in Los Angeles he's guys were all doing R&B shows
usually in the evening with her plan all kinds of R&B records by by independent labels and they
thing the world of
guy who really sort of towers Above the Rest
in terms of influence and importance was Alan freed and Alan freed really
became a kind of celebrity National celebrity
in an oven self in fact he became one
began to pick up some real
attention he was initially a sponsored by a fella named Leo men's who in Cleveland on one of
the biggest record stores called record rendezvous Leo mints had been sponsoring a classical music Show Goes
guess they thought most decent people have gone to bed they decided
to put on the show devoted to R&B music so in other words
all that stuff and very effectively most of his listeners were surprised
to find out that Alan freed was actually white
at the kids started coming in the store and buying the R&B records but
all of a sudden all of a sudden all these kids show
of things didn't think so it didn't think that was
so these white these black
are there eventually that
show of his The Ellen free show get some gets goes into syndication nationally so
get to hear them all over the country. He does
were really super flimsy plots with just an
from 1957 so important figure
us to think about Indie labels
in early rock and roll we
said before last week that the the major labels Deca Mercury RCA Victor
Columbia Capital at MGM I really were the ones that got all the money I
had all the wherewithal to very quickly and efficiently distribute their records nationally an independent
the record stores and that's the way it works it's
other business and R&B and country and western so much because it was just too small potatoes
really had to work hard to promote their records after all it was their money that
sometimes it would just be
the mainstream pop charts as we talked about in 1919 we'll talk in a minute we talked about
the mainstream pop label well then they started to cut in to the major labels Mark chair then they
were a lot more concerned about that and then the race
talk in the next video about how
most consideration from Scholars are a magazine called cash box and especially the magazine
called billboard these Magazines worth design not for fans to
read they weren't like fan magazines like Rolling Stone or
service do I had jukebox business what
magazine tell you what the Nashville Transit Auburn Regional trans are is very very valuable interview somebody
who's in record retail you
meant to do and because of that they were divided up into markets
point I should say a
word or at least a sore sound a warning about using chart numbers
too much I will talk to
you about chart numbers is an indication of popularity of
Records in the book The Textbook if
you're following a textbook you'll see a lot of charge and respect you should know the
chart numbers are are fairly course instrument trying to
figure out the popularity of a particular record a record
goes to number one or number two or
number 3 and number 4 is probably not a big distinction
are there
they where they placed general
be able to make istocknow about crossover
records and crossover songs are there really to talk about crossover that is when I went to
because people were already doing lots
of different versions of songs there are there are those kinds
of piercings usually involve putting your own personal stamp on
a record it turned out though during this. That they're actually cover versions that were more like
duplicates in other words you are making a record that sounded exactly like
God of white guys right and so this kind of thing in
this is this is the part where she was trying to
go into the area of controversy in certain kinds of disputes are there
broken out over this in the
the record business they come
the pop charts but by 1958 94% of
of the controversy is whether or not this really is a kind of a ripping
off or not know if you've heard the argument that comes from people like a little Richard and
and others felt like they didn't get the money they
songs would not have been playable on
people in that in that way they were really certified adapting
is that because it's a success the crossover success
the point where all of a sudden something that had been kind of in a once in
a look at who some of the first rock and rollers were who they
a famous New Orleans musician Fats Domino was an interesting kind of a entertainer of for
these years Fats Domino and African American guy
rhythm and blues or Rhythm Blues culture some of his early R&B hits that didn't cross
one called going home from 1952 there are several more its first big
Berry coming out of St Louis Ave via Chicago He recorded
on Chess Records was introduced to the guys at chess records by Muddy Waters Chuck Berry
was also a big Seattle country music in his autobiography he
of the country voice when he was recording those
a black guy they thought
it was white and they're actually saw some television eclipse from the
had to do with the writing of Maybelline or
a piece of the publishing which meant that every time Islands
Wills and his Texas Playboys in fact he was
kind of a Hokum Blues all the metaphors are so thickly Veil that
you really can't tell that there could be any kind of sexual content but
I'll leave it to you to check it
Tutti Frutti from 1955 which
was a number 2 hit on R&B charts but only got the number 17 on the pop chart the
pale blue Persian got to number 12 Long Tall Sally a
1956 was the number
one hit number 6 on the pop charts Good Golly Miss Molly 1954 was number 4 on
maybe a little raw bar and rougher than fats Domino's music of Chuck Berry's but they at least three
guys Fats Domino Chuck Berry Little Richard along with
Bill Haley right there at the very beginning of rock and roll now
let's move on to this idea of the whitening of rhythm
and blues that we talked about in the last lecture and and and think a little bit about
this Bill Haley
Explorer Daniel Boone and record for an indie label in Gallatin
Tennessee. Called. His version of the Fats Domino
version of tutti-frutti-live-little-richard in a 1912 beating out Richards azra passing
it in the charts on the way it usually takes the brunt of the heat for
are in certain kinds of which I had a whole ton of hits that
them even crossing over people surprised
stars from 1955 return
people before him like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby Elvis was
a song stylist but he was a fantastically charismatic performer young
about I mention that because a lot
of times the Elvis of later years the Elvis of the early 1970s for example
is not releasing so much that with the early Elvis
videos you should check it out anyway Elvis himself born in
tape for his mom's birthday and
so he did that in 1953 and started hanging around the the the studio there once Sam Phillips Sun
a lot of country western music
fact and in the end it with a what mostly white
the other kids he was so dedicated to rhythm and blues culture Sam Phillips sees
this young Escape coming
in he starts to show up for
sessions there's a story that at one session for
the prisoners he actually tried to offer advice about what
use either of those but he
saw some kind of Promise in Elvis Presley and so he put them together with Scotty Moore and Bill
black two more experienced musicians who he trusted to kind of work with Elvis to
over to a white audience he always said
famously if I could find a black guy or if
Scotty and and Bill and they were doing
all kinds of Tuesday were a lot of them were sort of almost like Dean Martin ish kinds
of sort of crooner songs and they did a hole session of
the story is off two told Sam Phillips head to fix something
having to do with his his recording equipment had to
head pops up and he says what's that and he said I
was just nothing we're just fooling around let's record it and so they
record that's alright Mama and of course I wouldn't you know it that becomes the song in
there it is the A and B side of that of that single from 1954 after he
made that record Saint Philip's immediately took it
out to his friend Dewey Phillips no relation
that does not brothers are finally ours but they didn't have the same last
on Louisiana hayride
Colonel Tom Parker who had previously managed Hank Snow a country western singer that
Presley and get him signed to RCA records so
they've been this is the first time somebody had
asked Sam Phillips to sell Elvis's contract but
Tom Parker Brokers to steal for what are the time seemed like an enormous amount of money he brokered
a deal to sell the sun
contract to RCA for $35,000 plus
Elvis would get $5,000 in back royalties that he was out for
a crucial step for rock and roll and because he was now with this
major label they were able to get him television appearances so he appears in early 1956
on The Dorsey Brothers show
get very good for the ratings and was extremely controversial and then
a couple of times on the Steve Allen Show where it was controversial one of them or he even
on one of these performances and going into
a kind of almost stripper bump and grind kind
top hits on all
I got involved this
Elvis never wrote any songs we talked about a Chuck
session we knew this
we know this from various accounts including those of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller who were
there had him going through song after song
after song with the Bandit I found something that he thought fit him just right
you didn't want released it wouldn't be released Elvis was the final Arbiter of what happened musically speaking and
talented singer he really understood his own talents is on music his own approach he Blended together pop
country western and R&B singers. You can hear awful lot
of Dean Martin for example in
Elvis with that he does a lot
in a lot of things he does sound very Elvis
unique vocal style
have been drafted into the army MKT 1958
on a day that everybody thought was Black Monday Elvis Presley
was inducted into the armed services and was away for a couple of years but Elvis is Success opened
up opportunity for other rock and roll artists so let's turn our attention to them in the next lecture
would have sold Elvis's contract the
know if you have a singer like Elvis Presley
to pay in order to make as many cops as
the Jukebox people whenever they're not going to pay you
for those records until sometimes months
later so if you're a small independent label and you've only got so much Capital to
work with and you'll put out all this Capital to
up for Renewal anyway and there's no guarantee that Elvis would have re-signed it and this
and use it to reinvest in
like Johnny Cash Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee
Lewis and Carl Perkins maybe he thought he would take that money and would
reinvest in his business Kennywood grow the entire thing even if
scene in 1956 when he signed with RCA and they put all their promotional muscle
behind him and he starts to have all this fantastic
55 to 59 or 60 let's stay with Sun Records for a minute and talk
about some of the artists who were still at Sun after Elvis Departed the first
Elvis did Carl Perkins had a record that was a
east coast to promote Blue Suede Shoes
they were in a car accident and he
nobody was killed but as
for the Beatles to cover later and
George Harrison was such a such a fan of
Carl Perkins that when
Ramon and John Lennon was Long John Lennon George
Harrison change this Carl Garrison not
exactly a dramatic change bailiwick kind of cute and fun
at Carl Perkins another one that was at Sun after Elvis Johnny Cash at a
crossover that's something we haven't talked about yet yeah I did this song could be a
hit first on the country-western chart and then cross over on a Pop-Tart last week we
I finally may be the biggest name the
most successful name at least for these years after Elvis is Jerry Lee Lewis whose
rockabilly artists we talked about this the southern style
wake of L to be their version of
Elvis Presley when Once RCA had one everybody I had to have one Eddie Cochran
was signed by Liberty out of Los Angeles and had a hit with them my twenty flight
week be very important studio for Phil Spector and
those wall of sound recordings both
Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran perform in a movie called The Girl Can't Help how from
1956 which
is sort of an upscale version of those
Alan freed movies I was talking about a couple of lectures
McCartney often talks
about the how influential that movie was
in the performances in
it especially the Eddie Cochran performance
of twenty flight
Rock in many ways Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent we're probably
more influential in the UK and that
other important rockabilly Stars
I'm going to say if discussion of
them for next week when we talked about music
in the between 1960
and 1963 because both Ricky
Nelson and the Everly Brothers went on to have a lot of
success rate of into that era and
so will save discussion of those will double back and pick up on those
those guys when we get to that point. Let's talk a little bit about
something I called rockabilly ladies one of the things we
why not a female Elvis that that could be something we could sell some records and so Janice Martin
so she had a single that
came out called drugstore Rock from 1956 that I gets kind
of into the teen teen life into go to the drugstore the soda the
soda fountain there but then she had a song called my boys from 1956 Wanda
Jackson had a
tune up a bunch of sort of rockabilly Tunes from
that are made of the biggest one at the very end of this year are called let's have
a party from 1960's she knew Elvis Presley I personally and he sort of talked one
a kind of footnote to the history but
assertive show issue that the people in the industry didn't quite know what they were doing
Sean actually
Elvis did in this lecture is Buddy Holly Buddy Holly
trick they decided
that some of the records would
be released as Buddy Holly on the deck of subsidiary coral and some of the others would be
and be able to maybe have more chance of getting on a charge for getting more records
that we really think of is being Buddy Holly Tunes some of them were Buddy Holly to the
symptoms of a trip to speaking with crickets in Zelda now at all anthologies
they're basically thought I was Buddy Holly and the Crickets sing guys
the Buddy Holly Peggy Sue from
1957 old boy from nineteen fifty-seven maybe baby from 1958 Buddy Holly was much covered
by other artists so we've got the Beatles doing Words of Love Rolling Stones doing don't
Fade Away Linda Ronstadt doing it's so easy and lots and lots of others later buddy unfortunately
rock and roll and its original Incarnation this
as I said in the last video by 1959 Rock
was up against some
it we were talking about just most recently Buddy Holly and and people like that there's some real problems
that start to hit at the end of
the decade may be the most obvious one being
as we said we were talking about Elvis and 1958 Elvis goes
into the army now Colonel Tom
Parker was smart about having a bunch of between record it up so that
to a certain extent it turns out some stories go that Elvis could have actually gotten not
by 58th and Elvis was out of the picture we talked in the last video
about how Buddy Holly died in a plane crash in February of 1959 Little
Richard quit rock and roll to preach in late 1957 figuring that
rock and roll was the devil's music this goes to this
that if you get me down from this plane alive I
he was out by late 1957 a Chuck Chuck Berry
in late 1959 was arrested for violating
a successful black American in this country he appealed the conviction and ended up
having to do some a prison time for that but anyway he was
he was out for a while I'll buy late 1959 there was the Jerry Lee Lewis Scandal
and may of 1958 his third wife Myra was a Ashley his cousin once removed it turns out that
such a scandal that have basically forced Jerry Lee Lewis out
of out of the mainstream pop world
was in fact the case now is it turned out a congressional
especially and radio and to a certain extent that television so the house special subcommittee
not particularly Cooperative he eventually pleaded guilty to
taking bribes he was he got a suspended sentence and
a $300 fine but here by that time he'd already
been fired from every job that he had when he was at the height of his career so no
more radio no more TV no more nothing and by 1965 he
was sort of died kind of
a Broken Man and so is too bad about how all
of that turned out for Alan freed and Dick Clark was able to get through it all one of
the effects are there any effects to the real investigation one
of them is that it made radio stations much conservative in
this in the sense that they were fearful of losing your license is I mean
a radio station can only broadcast if it has a license by the federal
that can get you into into trouble and so after all the rock and
From 1955 to 59 have been dominated by independent labels and artist to you know defied tradition
and maybe Pollock regular polite behavior in that kind of thing if it was kind of the wild west
of the music business after that after all
this pale the thing and
various musicians were out of it the next era was the music business taking control of
could sell records to but they figured they could probably do it better and more efficiently if they took
it over and so that's essentially what
happened so why would I try to figure out next week is when is
happens are these years from 1960 through the end of 1963 The
Beatles at this country in the early 1964 that. Between Elvis
and The Beatles is this.
I kind of a dark ages for rock
music when rock
all right we continue talking about mainstream pop now in the first video we
were inauthentic because but that's just the way it is back in those days the music business dominated
by music Publishers another question arises how did people actually
gain access to this is how they find out about
it and I think about that we have to start by
was very different and you
when it comes to talking about Styles we talked about folk music we talked about country music when
we talk about blues music we can talk
about styles are associated with certain cities people
know what Chicago Blues is or Memphis or St
the same so we live in a world where there
were many more Regional accent but it
for entertainment and as I gave away just a minute ago radio in the
development of radio played a tremendously important role in
establishing a kind of a national
somewhere in
Tennessee could do the same people that music the
people in the big city in Detroit or Chicago or hearing that
starts to happen with the spread of radio so what can we say about radio it's
hard to imagine a world before radio actually for most of
us it's hard to imagine a world before the internet although I know I
would there was one I was there but never the last what would
a world before radio have been like already I was initially developed by a
fellow by the name of Marconi made his first important sort of
experiment to show that you can do this thing of sending voices through the
air in 1895 the benefit of
early on was thought to be two things
on the battlefield
we have to talk to them instantaneously without having
for space Technologies
and putting a man on the moon week we
gained a lot of microchip technology that would
have put that they made the internet possible the other thing that it was talking to
to make its first big impact in 1912 when
the Titanic sank and it
was possible to send radio Transmissions of what was happening on the Titanic back to New York via
kind of radio Telegraph system
you know the right at
the desk taking down and information was a fellow by the name of David
Sarnoff David Sarnoff
went on
to have a career running RCA
and developing the NBC Radio
going down that they were able to read newspaper reports it seems almost in real
up around major cities by XIX by the end of the 1920s Radio Networks have
begun to a pop up in this country and so NBC and CBS and other networks were able
different cities and then they can they can play the same programming around
of these station is affiliate stations and then by connecting in certain stations that were called superstations superstitions
together you could reach from coast to coast Fantastico can
imagine that the
radio could now reach a whole
so what happens in popular music is
true radio it establishes a national audience and what's on at this
seen as really really Politically Incorrect by today's standards Amos &
Andy was up was the one of the Absurd great comedy shows
of its day adventure shows like the Lone Ranger and
Superman variety
shows like one famous one that was hosted by Bing Crosby and of course music lots of music lots
musicians playing music over the radio Airway so if you were one of the song Publishers who
wanted to get your song her get it
you want to do was get that song on the radio show radio and
the publishing business we're in a sort of
where we're working hand-in-glove to promote popular music in addition to the other kinds of things that
radio is doing that you can also say that movies help provide National audience
because once a movie is made The Wizard of Oz for example
national audience for music but after the
second world war Davidson off when I mentioned before gets this idea if
at least partially abandoned by some of the big money which goes to television but next
what we need to talk about is what did the music sound like
during this. Who were some of the most important artists in this. Of American pop before 1955
the end of 1963 the beginning of 1964 you may remember that
last week we were talking about that
roll was in such trouble in a lot of the major Figures were officine and
and there was a big Paola investigations
sort of took everything over and
turn it into something far less interesting
and edgy than it had been before or could
as they were trying to put this
a new team group so you'll get sweet but we'll talk about girl
we start now with the discussion of the brill building or or more specifically the brill building approach to
poppy music in many ways the brill building is the is the successor to
physical place is the place where most of the Tin Pan Alley songwriters still
had their offices the
street we always call it bro building but most of these people didn't actually
have offices
in the brill building the brill building is at 1619 Broadway
but you got to
go up to 51st Street to 1650 Broadway to get to the actual offices I
were some of these folks were a bit more about that
the songwriting performers do
many ways Blended in and became part of the African American community in Los
Angeles they hung out in the African American community that the way they tell the story they they
had black girlfriends their
friends were blocked and hung out on those I always
treated respectfully and and a very liberal like to say we thought we were black we were wrong
but that's what we thought at the time and so they very much embraced rhythm and blues practices but
became starlighter's in that practice starting up a label for a short. Of time a spark
records and recording songs for recording and writing songs with a
lot of La bands up that the robins was one group is a work with
a big mama Thornton was another one
dog which was later covered up
by Elvis Presley Big Mama Thornton that wasn't a 1953 interesting with a version that Elvis did
wasn't taken from the recording that
Libra stole their did a big mama Thornton but rather a version
Elvis heard a Las Vegas singer doing when he was when he was traveling through Las Vegas he
heard a guy doing the version the song with the lyrics I've
Been Changed Jerry Leiber
says he never wrote the line now you ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend
of mine that wasn't in
with a group called The Coasters which was
a version of the robins that moved from the west coast to the east coast
right so they came from the West Coast they
dolica New York they started
to work with Atlantic Records they had an independent deal with
it could work with Atlantic Records
but they can't work without a label to if they wanted to and from the
thought about how they wanted the record to
the musicians job to figure out how the songs you actually sound like
a group called The Coasters and what the coast they started borrowing songs from borrowing ideas from Broadway where
most important songwriters to
wrote songs for them everyday I mean
shop or or Workshop or
number one in 1961 by Little Eva who I think is The Story
Goes was actually there babysitter at the time and I
groups in fact that they are a great influence the
girl groups Gerry Goffin and Carole King Jeff Berry and Ellie
Greenwich where another eldan songwriting team to their big hits be my baby
Sedaka did a whole new version
of it and really had a kind of revivify career in
song after song after song
sense of what the brill building is so
from from here forward and of course whenever
Idols 4 Idol
non-threatening with
no danger of any kind of sexual advance or anything like that this
is the kind of guy that young girls could sit and listen to sing a
song as if he was singing it only to them but maybe he would hold her hand or
kiss him on the cheek but what he really wanted to know was to get
to know their personality really want to do is get to know their personality and
look great so rather than being a musician should have wrote the top because they had
the voice and the music so I can but that's essentially
what they were doing these these Teen Idols were probably more modeled on
somebody like Pat Boone in the kind of very short of
he was out by 1960
eat in Hollywood during
this. Of the early 60s through the mid-60s by Elvis even took
a turn in the direction of Teen Idol there a couple of tunes if is especially are you
lonely tonight
which was the number one hit for him and 1960 it's
a it's a song that goes back to the 1920s the first group to have a hit with
it was a group called
Blue Baron in
of vaguely Shakespearean kinds of lines but anyway there their
they're like it's almost like he's speaking them into the ear of the young girl who should have listening
rock and roll behind and moving more in a direction of
talent to do the gig I mean it was more about the look but some
of them actually we're pretty talented guys and went
on to do some interesting things and it had plenty of talent I die like Frankie Avalon for
example he and I'll talk a
minute about Fabian both
of these guys came out of Philadelphia and were
managed by Bob marcucci's we're on Chancellor records Bob marcucci woodlot X write the songs he would
produce the record and he on the label he was sort of like a awful
Larry Parnes who will will talk
about next week we talked about the Beatles in the
UK who was doing a similar thing with the aisles by Frankie Avalon
is one of
his number one hits for him in 1959 Venus
is one of them another one's called why but then
as the sixties unfold Frankie Avalon only has hits on the charts as a teen idle but he
looks great maybe favorite he had had had less vocal technique
talked about Justin the last lecture with regard to the brill building approach a Bobby Vinton on Epic
Got a New York City of the Epic was a subsidiary of
Lover but he had a hit with the song called Mack
the Knife which
actually comes from a vile opera
called the Threepenny Opera so it was a kind of
a crossover from a piece from classical music or at least four or Music Theater
in to into rock and roll and some idea of what
was going on with the Teen Idols the ideal
boyfriend the maybe
a little bit to cynically constructed product right
producers and the girl groups
I mentioned earlier in the lectures this week about the rise of the producer and I'd like to
take a little bit more time to focus on that and the way that developed during
basically what's called
an A&R man artists and repertoire in an armed man
you know you got to pay for studio
there to be sure everything was getting done but usually that that person was not in
might not have been the stronger they might be producing somebody
even better or differently or
more interesting than they can actually sound acoustic lie
this kind of thing. Just recording and his big fat people who
have an idea how they
want the record to sound or different styles they
wanted to touch on various kinds of ways in which they want to project the song
do you starting to move toward this idea
cuz basically can be can be reproduced in various versions just starting to
move Corydon I did here already that
it's a particular version it sounds a particular way that you might want to have 4:30 to
move toward the kinds of
things we'll see how Brian Wilson doing it that sounds of the
Beach Boys doing in Sergeant Pepper but it's
very early days now leave her stroller as
they were the top songwriters in the business starting from working on
producing singles for the robins Smokey Joe's Cafe
talked about before down in Mexico for 1956 Yakety Yak from 1958 Charlie Brown from
1959 records for the for the the coasters in Fridley Prince told her because they really do what
Chuck Berry was doing
that is a Yakety Yak talks about
a kid that if he doesn't do his chores he won't get his
for Libra installer is a record for The Drifters called There Goes My Baby from 1959
a song where Carole King had such a specific idea about how
she wanted some of the parts played for example the
timpani part that she couldn't just stay in
early 60s were
talking about Phil Spector and I were talking
about Phil Spector we're talking about
the wall of Sound by Phil
from such things and so basically a
sort of apprenticeship with Libra
installer I started to get into the studio and developed his own approach to
in those days and still today means all the sound is coming through a single speaker now most people
can so he gets tough
tons of instruments into
a recording studio everybody gets a microphone at the sound of this guy's instrument
is going into
who did City distinctive kind of sound it's called the
wall of sound and it's entirely associated with
Phil Spector back
with Barry Mann and Ellie Jeff. Ellie Greenwich I was
features Darlene Love on me vocals check out the crystals to do round rock or they are The
Ronettes Be My Baby from 1963 that one's got Rowdy Bennett
give you a sense of what Phil Spector and the wall of sound we're all about
version is production of the Righteous Brothers You've Got That Loving Feeling when
be album produced the first couple solo
albums by John Lennon and George Harrison so Phil
they use the recordings to reverse its own kind of instrument and they see that
is a fantastic you know move forward for
Wilson and the Beatles start to get ahold of the recording studio
work and and becomes her two students and and and
style called Sweet Soul and the
the roots of Sweet Soul probably go back to people like Nat King Cole and
Johnny Mathis that is kind of crooner type black singers who were singing songs that work more sort
of adult romantic kind
of tunes than teen teen
kinds of song so good examples of
and he's up he's a good example of somebody who who who moved from
gospel to pop but felt very
woman or some kind of thing
a while there but whatever he died he died too young but was a fantastic voice
a hold of it and start to blend R&B music with
classical strings
and Latin rhythms the first one of these who I promised in
the last video that we would talk about is there goes my baby a number
2 hit in 1959 you know when they're when there go there goes my baby was finished and Libra
installer brought it to Jerry Wexler who
at that time was running the show
at Atlantic Records Orwell running a lot of the show at
Atlantic Records at the time Wexler didn't think they should release
it because it sounded had these R&B things going on
and if it sounds very sort of doo wop and then I had these classical they not
only just classical strings but it'll sort of Milotic figures in the
something like that and he thought you know he thought it was such a blend of
two different styles that it was it would be nobody would like it to
like a radio that
that was stuck between
and less satisfied with the idea that
pop is disposable music that
such a such a fantastic blending of R&B
with a kind of classical sophistication with
about MTV and part
appeal or the dissemination of musical style
Horseman MTV comes
in early 1980s and then becomes very big at all starts to become about the video but by
the time MTV comes in it's not like that's a new idea it's been
of show that wasn't the kind of an adaptation of
of a a disc jockey radio show
so instead of just having a dish jockey a
when you didn't have National programme to play a lot of
time just would be
that after school during the day when there wasn't a high demand for or prime time
or 4 or 4 National programme to be played what happened with American Bandstand is
but what scene from
has even
if these things were true you can't have a hose to any of that kind of doubt
other kids dancing of course dancing
the show during the day those performers weren't actually performing the
tunes they
be playing in the background out for some of the Teen Idols that might have
actual live performances and
those also went under the American Bandstand title so if you're
daytime show that they were talking about here but anyway not this idea of a focusing on Dancing really
will come back the dancing end of it important TV that we
actually perform
on television most of these variety shows were alive so if you go and and
and look for old variety show performances of of Elvis Presley or
Jerry Lee Lewis I mean they're not lip-sync that
all you can tell Aunt and they're exciting from that point of view probably the most important of the
important person will return to him a little bit later than this week's of lectures is Ricky Nelson Ricky
was in the movie business with his first movie in late 1956 in fact after he
done all those television appearances we talked about last week The Dorsey
Brothers show the Steve Allen Show the
Milton Berle show and Ed Sullivan Show by late 1956 he
had to fill out Love Me Tender where he was featured a 1957 is
Jailhouse Rock the one that we talked about before that libran Stoller writing a
was to mainstream his career and so he did a whole sequence of
good movies at all and
bits of it on the internet you really should check it out anyway so in terms of Music in
the early 1960s every one of those Elvis record Elvis movies had a couple of songs and there
was a soundtrack album to go with it so they were essentially used to Market Elvis Presley if you
shows like American Bandstand interesting thing about a dance
all I dance craze is about dancing and we're going to come up against the same issue
this kind
of difference in what's important when we
to call him Chubby Checker so if
I talked before about cover
versions and how you can do your own version of that was a
was exactly like the other record that maybe was a little bit
less defensible when we talked about the issue of
the controversy surrounding that was this record by Chubby Checker The Twist was
in fact a duplicate it was a duplicate of a record that had
been done by the songwriter Hank Ballard
so Hank Ballard African American
he made sure he had money and Publishing in
looking into is this really a legitimate kind
of thing to do anyway. The record launch the
whole craze for the Twist and wherever
thought it was about kids watching kids dance
but he's very soon discovered that older people like
to watch
the kids dance to and the twist was that song that allowed people to say
they like rock and roll if you want it's it was sort of
like the final step in in crossover for for rock and roll and out was no longer dirty but
before about these white cover versions transforming everything that had to do with sexuality in some of these
rhythm and blues songs into dancing now we get to the twist
we get to American Bandstand the transformation
from sexuality to
dancing is officially complete now there
turned to the idea of what would be happening after you put childish things
folk music has an interesting past in American popular
music in the
a kind of folk Revival next week when we talked about
one part of the market but it wasn't the entire mainstream
maybe the preteen kids and the college age kids
who used to be fans of Elvis Presley and
poetry a lot of people got interested in classical music as well
but folk music was a kind of music that
and folk music that do you know we're sort of all in this together we're all equals there's
at a certain kind of way come out the roots of
both go back to the forties and into
the early 1950s with people like the Weavers Woody
Guthrie Pete Seeger writing music
that was really about social problems and a kind of an approach to everybody sharing
your things together this land is your land this land is my land but in some
of those early songs are Bow-Toons like the Weavers Goodnight Irene
which was
the number one hit on the pop charts in 1954 on top of old smokey a
number 2 hit in 1951 but
in the country right Leah wrongly whatever you may think
really did believe in communism has to sort of put a damper on their ability
of the 1950s when folk
music starts to revive in the late 1950s it really stays away from political
issues the most important group in this part of this folk
Revival is a group out of San Francisco called the Kingston Trio they take
their name the Kingston Trio from this
fascination we had four calypso music
kind of think and so Kingston was kind of you
know got it in the air and kind of
a cat thing to do so they were the Kingston Trio
nineteenth-century song that deals with a murderer in
this kind of it doesn't get into issues out of a civil rights or or socio-economic problems or
issues or politics or anything like that it deals with these kinds serious issues from historical
this. And when somebody thought up what is folk music in the. Before the arrival of Bob Dylan
and Rodger McGuinn and all these guys with folk-rock in
1965 folk music probably meant
either the Kingston Trio or Cooper going to talk about just a
minute Peter Paul and Mary. It's important for
16052 folk
music really meant the Kingston Trio in many cases they were very very successful other groups of
note that are similar to the Kingston Trio would be The Highwaymen the
rooftop singers or perhaps most importantly the new Christy minstrels all of these groups of
very polished happy kind of folks out that stayed way clear of any
kind of controversy or political affiliation if you're interested in the whole scene around
of all this but much of like lot
of those Christopher Guest movies much of
know comedic and not not Accura Precision anybody in particular about Peter Paul and Mary
Joan Baez is being
important Focus during the 1960's it really doesn't happen until the second truly about
this for the milder more
commercial form of itself is
time and it was fine for coffee houses in for Greenwich Village and people who
dealing with large is
relegated to being a very talented writer of songs that other people are performed as Folk begins to
unfold into the decade into 1963 1964
it's increasingly involved
with the Civil Rights Movement effect of the famous
I Have a Dream speech that was done by Martin Luther King by Peter Paul and Mary
so this this
return back to
politics starts to make its way into folk music as the
sixties unfold first through the civil rights movement and then through the protest movement around the Vietnam War
politically concern kind of attitude that it had back when it got in trouble with the the
McCarthy folks back
in the 1950s this is. Of of neutrality
and then assertive slow move back
rockabilly artists Elvis was
a little bit broader than that but
Brothers are for this
week because they had hits that continued on into the
into the early 1960s
and so they kind of crossed the
boundary from the late 50s into the early 1960s base rockabilly is
I calling rockabilly popsters that
a safe Elvis it's
software version of rockabilly are the Everly
Brothers and as I said before the Everly Brothers go back
into the 1950s and really I should have contemporary with
involves High armony singing and so that's it
we talked about them in the first week a cup roast for
Chet Atkins the
famous country guitarists who was working at RCA at the time as a producer effect produced
some of those Elvis Presley session when Elvis move from
Sun to RCA and so that they were assigned to a
to a cup Rose by Wesley Rose and Wesley Rose promised them that they signed with
a capros because they broke their own songs too if they
did he would get them a recording contract because they've been having a hard
time getting recording contract Chet Atkins for as much of a fan
that's what they record with for the balance of the 1950s there Harmony singing
a kind of Everly Brothers
from their late 1950s bye bye love Wake
From 60 through
63 course I promise
to stay a little bit more about Ricky Nelson because we talked
banned later he was way connected inside Los
Angeles and and the music business
I mean let's face it he had a
hear an early instance of Ricky
Nelson I'll believe what you say is number for hit for 1958 pretty good example many of songs written
by a classic rockabilly songwriting Duo call Johnny
and Dorsey Burnette
player later ended up playing with Elvis during the Las Vegas
years and them often times Elvis concert posters
American kind of music that really spoke to the kind of good clean Southern California fun of mostly
middle-class white kids living close to the ocean and most
of the topics of surf music songs have to
do either with surfing or girls had
tradition so when we talk about surf music wish talk about it
in terms of two different kind of styles of surf music with the button divided into vocal styles and
instrumental Styles I'll start with instrumental
Styles first although the
among guitarist
and they enjoyed certain various periods of resurgence in the time since the early 1960s let's start with You
instrumental stuff the most important guitarist in
played the guitar strung upside down and he
stringed instrument that measure
Luke is is is derived from traditional music from the Middle East and so this circle whole approach
of instrumental surf music music that no vocals
they're just instrumental tracks it's it's interesting in
or or anyting else Wipeout is the sort of all was at least the Ultimate
Sword of drum solo song of its day other instrumental is
Step instrumental songs instrumental
versions of chapters one group that
and just to take a step outside or American perspective for a minute in the UK there
the idea that there was a singer there but I am a cliff Richard who
was sort of the British
tunes that sounded a lot like the ventures under under
and surfer girl there's no Surfer car there or
car girl but you get the idea that's
an awful lot about surfing it's interesting because aside from
brother Dennis Wilson
none of the rest of the Beach Boys were Surfers
sweet little
found out about it and not and came after the Beach Boys every subsequent version you find
it that song will say words and music by Brian
Wilson and Chuck Berry and
of adult contemporary
sound and there's also the
girl groups out Brian Wilson a fantastic admirer of Phil Spector he talks about the first
music for the first time driving in the car remember I talked about
with this is Jan and Dean initially there was a lot
music between 1960 and
1963 and very soon in February of 1964 The
are a kind of a dark ages for pop when Pop was taken over
by cynical music industry types
who didn't really
care about the music didn't really have much respect for
it and thought these kids will buy anything and
so turned out I really kind of second or third rate kind
of product that really didn't have any of the edginess or excitement of the original music
or was it a. Where there was a fantastic
I really could write their own music anywhere fantastically
charismatic British terms of Imaging so which do you think it is or was
it a golden era
for pop I'll let
you decide and I'll be back next week to talk to you about the British Invasion
it many ways the British Invasion was a real disruption of what had been happening in the American
of taken over by the music business people themselves rather than independent labels and
for teens
in 55 to 59 and they try to figure out ways to
get to my neck exploit that really and create new
like that music the Styles you celebrated were Sweet Soul girl groups the rise of the
tend to focus on that are the Teen Idols the dance craze the twist but mostly because
of their superficiality and their
of these things the next Elvis came from someplace nobody really
expected it to come from the next
let's take some time now to have a look at what was happening in the
UK during this.
The leading up to the British
Invasion here in this country that is the United States in 1964 remember
look at the charts in the UK you'll find a lot of those same records more records
by American artists artists
out of the US then by artists from the UK and even those artists from the UK in many
ways but mostly imitated American artists
homegrown certainly the attitude and American we'll talk about
this pretty soon it is the idea that it certainly was the attitude America's at UK music
wasn't as good as American Music In
the second world war when there was a lot of American presence in
the UK we brought our pop music with us British people
of became fans of American popular music and so popular music for
them was that the best popular music was
the most important in the UK is Cliff Richard Cliff Richard
in the. Between 1958 and nineteen 3
head 27 hit singles
Elvis I mean one hit after another he was a very very big stock there was also UK version
of the Teen Idols there
It Well in the UK
these guys including Tommy Steele Marty Wilde
and Billy Fury you can tell from all
these stage names that there's something aggressive and exciting about
his ex and a single hit
single. Single how these were all records that essentially invisible
hits in the early 1960s the only
two that was that are really really really
turns out where the backing band for
Billy Fury it turns out
this country than show me Cat in the UK still he's
important early independent producer in the UK also there was
a very different structure of how record labels and radios work in this
this really created a very different picture in a lot of kinds of poison this
country we talked about the growth of regional radio and how they were music
on the radio a bunch of different stations all
we had lots and lots of record labels was really important that we
to BBC because in
the government itself and so there were no stations in addition to
the BBC that you could tune into you had as much as as many
as three different states of three different
flavors of BBC but that was about it there was a station
called radio Luxembourg that was broadcasting from
with the something like radio Luxembourg was that the programming was
paid for by the record labels in terms
of record labels that were very few independent labels in the
UK it was a very very difficult Road
much smaller Market very much dominated by the major labels and
when you haven't got a lot of radio to get
your music to people and when
you have a limited number of a record stores I mean the population being
smaller a lot of record owners
weren't really interested in getting records for independent label they already had plenty of
product for the major lipids are very difficult to
really to to keep an independent label afloat so that meant a lot more of
what the Brits heard in terms of rock and
variety there was a different from the one we had here because they had all the British Artist that
we were talking about as well an important early movement
Donegan play was a member of a big band
we'll talk about tragic as in just a minute but was basically a adapted American folk music
often called
skip Wilcrest and that make kids all across the UK were getting inexpensive acoustic
guitars and learning the the first position chords that used to seize the Deez the a Minor's
that a Minor's and learning to play the schiphol teams which were essentially versions of American
traditional folk music all of
this happens before the folk Revival
that happened in America which we can trace back to 58 or 59 they were doing schiphol already
and 56 and
the Beatles music when we
look at their music and 63 64 and 65 other kinds of things Kristen
not like those are first UK ban to have done it
but certainly there was a lot more of it happening and it
was a lot more consistent anyway
so that
and John Mayall that'll be important to us in a little bit when we talked about
the roots of The Rolling Stones and some
of the other Stones type groups like The Yardbirds and and any
jazz blues revivalist these were all folks who perhaps because they were enamored by the Americans when they came
American culture and so you get
this Fascination
by sometimes you know very educated and and and sophisticated middle-class people and some of the
music that's most associated with the the the poorest and most underprivileged elements of American culture it's
things look like in the
UK leading up to 1963 let's now turn our attention to the rise of the Beatles
just because the Beatles are so popular and you wanted
at the end of the 1950s
basically Northern England Liverpool and thought of as really kind of industrial Immokalee middle class but the Beatles up
rings we're not poor sometimes it's
was underage only 17 years old at that
music do you need to know you need to know an awful
lot of music you're playing constantly 6 hours a night
music they learn song after song at the song to learn to me to tell their cover versions are
in northern England once they came back they were they were were
signed by a guy who has never managed to ban before Brian Epstein but whose family owns
bought a
lot of records are sold a lot of Records to Brian up science family
so they didn't want to upset by the family but the day they gave them was the first of
January 1962 I
mean imagine I
guess the Studio's not being used
on New Year's Day we can have these beetles kids from Liverpool come down Brian Epstein shopped around
London nobody would
take it a dick
signed a group group called Brian
Poole and the tremeloes because they're from Brighton & Brighton was a closer train ride then
the guy who picked up the Beatles was George Martin finally after almost everybody in town
turn the group down George Martin
had been working for Emi one of
the major labels there since 1950 and was producing
records for a Emi subsidiary called parlophone it so George Martin
saw something in the group and began to work with
OK hit 19 take it was like a number 17 hit
with love me too and then continued to have much more success into 1963 with Please
the big year for the
Beatles In The Summer of 1963 things
were going so well that the British press coined
other groups and so in nineteen sixty-three a number of British groups
of what they called the beat music type course the British Invasion
starting to have hits in 96 so much so that
the Beatles success and the group that followed after
them actually created
the first year in British popular music were there were more British Acts in the top Slots of
the British charts then there were American act so many
ways the British think that the British success at the Beatles in its own is
historically noteworthy not even
before we get to the fair that they came
to America and conquer the world know that they changed
good as American music maybe even better
glow by the fall of 1963 everything was really coming up roses
The Ed Sullivan Show then I was a royal Command
Performance where they played for members of the British royalty John Lennon famously
introducing Twist and Shout by saying those of you in the cheaper seats clap your
everything about them from Liverpool mark them as coming from relatively
humble beginnings
color charm in the UK
had to do that to do with feathered they came from Humble standing in society but
all that kind of think and so we all thought
is Ed Sullivan Show was a show that we had
really good ratings it was a fantastic in their play three weeks in a
the in the winter time and then they film the
famous one and as reports go crime in the city of
for a minute to watch The Beatles on Ed Sullivan what whatever however it went they had a number
one hit with I Want to Hold Your Hand Capitol
first four hits were released in this country on Independent labels Vijay and Swan Capital thought nobody wants
to hear British music in America they finally had to
these records out and when they did and put
the promotional campaign and the Beatles
on Ed Sullivan then all
kind of an act in this that kind of business effect
for the first time UK artist competed on an even playing field with
when they came in 1964 they really opened up a whole new set of opportunities for
the whole bunch of groups are flooded
into the country all of them with mop
top haircut to matching suits in British accents and oppress you know kept wanting
to tell the story that the Beatles were now not
the hot new thing Herman's Hermits was
the hot new thing or something like that it wasn't clear
initially that the Beatles we're going to survive in prison for in destiny work in the
the Paradigm for what it is to be a rock musician in general
during this. Between 1964 and
which are now to the idea of the movement from Craftsman two
artists in the music of The Beatles and not just the Beatles but whilst we can
on a table and it works perfectly and produces the results
they what they do what they do they repeat that
element of craft and every table
they make after that they found a good way of doing
it they do it that way again and again and again that's considered an aspect of
crap they don't say well I built one table that way I couldn't possibly build another
one that way I would just be repeating myself
he just rewriting the
same Symphony over and over again or she's just a recording the same
song over and over again when you say that you
erased basically saying by repeating something they've already. They have no originality they're not doing
new things and don't want to be accused of repeating yourself too much are these
last person if you prefer for the Beatles Craftsman means being songwriters in the
tradition of American popular song so if you want to check out
some of the early Beatles music that really kind
are are are Brill building type of pop songs by A
in large part through the influence of Bob Dylan are you begin to see them in songs like help
they actually met Dylan in the fall of 1964 why
than that we're know within the folk Community but you really should have had to be in the know
to know about the end the Beatles were they admire your Dylan I hate he spoke with
John Paul they got together and and and he urged them to do more with their lyrics and just
talked about I love you she lives may I hold your
hand she loves you a kissy kissy and try
to get it at things that work that were more serious made it to the first the first
signs we see if that really going to happen on Help the album help from 1965
music it's not the only one that use but it's an important one that used by a
lot of America stronger than people like
Cole Porter George and Ira Gershwin
of count on the fingers of both hand the number
of songs that don't do a APA format 75 or 80 per-cent didn't just stumble onto the
ABA form and just keep doing it over and over again I knew what it
was because they study this music and they were replica and I think proud to the word
1966 and 65 you get a song like Norwegian Wood which
formerly is
like nothing I've ever done before. Only it's like nothing you've
ever done before tells it an interesting kind of Story from
beginning to end the first use of the sitarist
you see instrumentation coming in 19th at a 66 how we get Eleanor Rigby which assertive
Paul's song about
existential angst in and alienation in this kind of
thing off for no one a song about a broken marriage that
uses that
uses a French horn tied up in anticipation of the piccolo trumpet you using Penny
Lane later in 1966 early 1967 Eleanor Rigby by the way uses the
strings it's kind of
Knows at the end of the revolver album 1966 is filled with John Lennon reciting lyrics
drawing from the Timothy Leary the Psychedelic experience which
between I want to hold your hand
and Tomorrow Never Knows but they're really only separated by
about two years maybe a little over two years time and
the distance from I
Want to Hold Your Hand to Tomorrow Never Knows is the distance from Craftsman
to artists and that's what happens in The Beatles
the beach boys are doing the surf visit to talk about that next week Brian Wilson Dylan is
doing his music and laughter groups were imitating
artists are to think of the rock musician started thinking that sells s'mores artist then is craftspersons a new
kind of aesthetic begins to
develop in rock and roll and it's what we might call authenticity in rock what this means is this
you write your own songs which really are about who you are and what you feel or think
you play your own instruments on
the records
business craftsperson like
it is but you know just a couple years
earlier the birds who are kind of one of the icons of musical authenticity release a
musicians themselves playing on
the record if it's not it's an authentic it also means authenticity in control
very important that that your project that and the
forward that's that's that's where
you're going to Alternative something new something different
always try to expand call with the one exception that it
is possible to go
back to your roots
this aesthetic of authenticity that I just outline but you know what
start talking about that in a couple weeks, we'll talk about how FM Rock continue is this
kind of thing and ephemera is album-oriented artist
the aesthetic of authenticity these kinds of things we haven't talked about that let's now turn
to the rise of Blues in the UK or the
the Revival of Blues in the UK and how that will lead to
groups like The Rolling Stones and
I mentioned earlier that there was a real movement of Blues Revival in London
and it. Of the early 1960s
often I'm
United States they
had been released on Independent
labels which already had
distribution problems inside the United States not to mention trying to get these records over to
the to the UK and so often times you had to send Away by mail order
to get Blues records and went when they came
after some weeks time and you unwrap them and you were the one person who
in town maybe or one very few people in town who actually had that record
absence of radio that
would do that for you that was a way you could find out about music that you didn't
already own yourself and said he's turned into evenings where
musicians Faithfully reproduced the
music mostly of Chicago Blues so
was called Blues Incorporated and they established Blues Nights
clean the harmonica performance is the tone of the guitar the
drums the piano all these guys are things when you listen to
coats and smoking pipes you think for sure this
it come out of a Chicago Club sometime in the late 1950s they are very very stressful tribute
the front row checking out with these guys are doing Mick Jagger
gets his first opportunity to
sing when he fills in for the
singer from this group of the name of Long John baldry who got an opportunity to appear on
as I said before Liverpool's a port city the sailors that would go across to the US would buy
bucketloads of Records because they knew they could sell them for good money almost people
do with eBay now we go over to the US and get those
in Liverpool then was available to these Blues Enthusiast
in London because they had this
is at least Sailors were
were coming back and
coming back and people who work in the temperature looking
looking look for like
next video about the Rolling Stones and the
way they emerge in the UK and in the US
Afghanistan a claim all of
with a smoking and drinking and the sloppy
went into the army what's
of sexual frustration let's say I
Can't Get No Satisfaction and when asked about
it wasn't too long ago maybe a
1963 1964 everybody was all work but the possibility there could be a swear word and Louie Louie
I mean to the extent that you know the FBI were brought in to
that's really where the stones really start to become the stone in many ways we look back
at is that the success of the stones and maybe because they became so
country it's as if what people saw in the Beatles were a
like a slinky or a mood ring or
a hula hoop really any British group that look kind of like it kind of what the Beatles did
signed to RCA all of
a sudden watch RCA on major-label got into
the game with Elvis Presley the other labels felt like they had to
find somebody to zydeco Science
Buddy Holly capital Gene Vincent people like that and
so what we find happening is all kinds of groups flooding in now some
of them we are ultimately forgettable in the sense that we study
them as part of the British Invasion they had head
Rolling Stones can be like Stevie Winwood in Spencer Davis The Yardbirds
were eventually morphed into Led Zeppelin these groups contain
groups or stones that groups if
they're Beatles type group the songs emphasize
production values are not quite as as
talk about there's Gerry and the Pacemakers a group
that was also from Liverpool also managed by Brian Epstein and also produced by George
somewhere along the line decided that as the years went by he wasn't going to license that
music to anthologies and
into into collected hits Collections
and things like that and so go out and try
nurse at the British Invasion Herman's Hermits
fact is less Herman's Hermits record stand up pretty well and Peter Noone has gone on
to have a pretty good singing career
I'm playing you know clubs and casinos in that kind of thing another group Beatles type group featuring Graham
Nash later of Crosby Stills
which was a actually a song about Marianne Faithfull
front should have with
Buddy Holly horn Rim glasses singing a song called Do the Freddie and Sarah
boobs really sore too focused on the vocals
focused on the song but not a lot of rough edges
that a lot of people who were members of these Stones type
growth end up having
groups of course is The
Jimmy Page came in first on base when the bass play
on the group quit Jimmy Page have been a session musician was doing tons
them on guitar so that was Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page on guitar they
a drama that he knew John Bonham and other session is
issued work with during his
Studio days John Paul Jones to put the group together we have to call the new Yardbirds but then
they decided they would change their name to Led Zeppelin and so you see The Yardbirds
the police at the end of the 70s going into the 80s and the Spencer Davis Group which featured
a young Stevie Winwood
all the stones type British bands his voice is the one that most likely pass for
actually being
an African-American Blues singer
from the late 1950s and what was funny as it came out of a skinny
or Stones type we have to be kind of
it no matter how we try and do it we can't
to those bands that we turn in the next video
of The Beatles the Stones The Beatles type groups and
the stones type groups there are two groups that really can't be
figured in
66 The Kinks actually had some success in the us too but it's surprising how little success the who
had in the US despite the the presence
of songs that we now think must have
the Beatles 2 2 2 create your own style that doesn't really fit easily into
aggressive kind of tuna starting with a guitar lick that maybe maybe a little bit influence by
uses a core progression very similar to you really got me and
turn against the status quo a well-respected man for example is a
good example of him offering critique of of Conformity and everyday expectations
so this kind of critical the thing that you see it with a group like Ballad of a
thin man from Bob Dylan or Nowhere Man
with vocals doing powerful music with increasingly
sophisticated lyrics and Concepts behind it the first
hit and 1965 in the US in fact it never even made
us early 60s hits got played
on the radio all the time and now they've been rolled into
the Classic Rock Radio format so
Beach where there was a famous Riot between two groups
the leather jacket greased back hair type you know change motor Pixar mode Harley motorcycle pipes and the
to listen to
Motown records They danced a lot in the who was
there start of iconic band they
asked a rapid flurry of questions and
so they say things like the John Lennon how did
you find America and he says turn left at Greenland at
if they ask Gringo are you
ways some parts of American music business continued as they were as I mentioned last week
you track the progress of Motown records to the 60s Motown records
would be back it would be folk-rock it
would be Dylan it would be the birds it would be a new kind of Southern California
kind of sound and and focus in the music
business and its to that American response to
I want to take just a minute to focus in on Les
may be surprised to
know that there is actually a guy named Les Paul and Les Paul is not just a brand or
for the Bing Crosby Group and also recorded on the side
with his with his Jazz ribbon and develop this do with his
wife Mary Ford one interesting thing about the Les Paul and Mary Ford recordings
is that Les Paul did this
thing with overdubbing his his
music where initially the
way he would do it is
you had two discs cutting machines like that you could put one
last Paul is instrumental in doing is creating
these layered Harmony's
was developed by the Germans during the second world war as a
whereby they could get lifelike reproductions of his voice send
worst they would do is ruin the tape recorder the Allies didn't
know anything about
and what
this and he said he told Bing Crosby
company and that ended up making him millions of
recording machines now we're talking about the early 1950s 8-track
his connection with them with with Bing Crosby they're also
nothing about Les Paul that we mentioned earlier is that
he is often referred to as the inventor of
the solid body electric guitar guitar
partnership with the Gibson guitar company and
they produce the Les Paul model the Les Paul guitar has become
iconic technology is overdubbing this tape Technologies
overdubbing technology development of
the solid body guitar solid by electric chair all day because
because none of his
none of his music was never Rock oriented but
Les Paul as a guitarist was
a fantastic influence on
a whole generation of guitarist
who came after him and rock and
roll Jimmy Page people like this
Ross or the big Les Paul
neck is the songs they heard when they were a kid not to put the technologies that
he develop will continue to influence rock and roll for many years in fact decades to
Bob Dylan was an important figure in the American response during the mid-1960s but he certainly wasn't the
only one that was that was making a difference in a sort of fending
by Rodger McGuinn guitarist along with David Crosby Gene Clark
Chris Hillman and Michael Clarke that group Gwen
and Crosby emerged
out of the Greenwich
of a good recording studios this kind of think it's so it makes
his folk act which I guess
was a little better a little bit strange for the day but you could already see the
beginnings of McGuinn I wanted to go in the direction of what the Beatles did their first the first
tambourine man which was a Dylan song
Elliott had been on the the the the recording they've done it something about
at the time Terry
Melcher got a hold of this recording in the birds heard it and so they
released in April of 1965 so just at the same time
of that song mr. tambourine man is not only that it combines a Beatles
guitar a Dylan song and this Bach influence
the introduction but also that it
uses the same Studio band as head work with Phil Spector in his
that has to do with share that I'll
tell you about in just a minute turn turn turn up Seger song which
again went to number one in the fall of 65 and Eight Miles High which is
a song that Gwen said
a there's a guitar string at the very beginning
is taking this folk thing as dealing with Aaron's return any of that jingly jingly
sound speaking of the jingle jangle I mentioned before previous video
that we would the producer Tom Wilson would
become an important member of Port part of this discussion let's talk a little bit about Simon Simon &
a.m. it kind of flopped it has call the sounds of silent but it's not the
Wednesday morning 3 a.m. which was on the same label
of made them one of the most important Act of that that erupt I
also coming out of La We Got
66 was a track called
Monday Monday so much
much success covering Dylan
McGuire who had a number one hit in the fall of 1965 so this is kind of just just
just just in months after the emergence of of folk rock and mr. tambourine man this
track is called Eve of Destruction and the
guy who wrote the song PF Sloan was essentially given the assignment I think it was by Lou Adler
that one for the turtles another group
from La a covered the Dylan song It Ain't Me Babe and had a
number eight hit with that in 1965 the the turtles made up
of dual singers
Mark volman and Howard Kaylan would later
be known as fluorescent fluorescent lee-chin Eddie
or Flo and Eddie when they appeared on Frank Zappa albums and then had their own solo career
in the seventies early on they were the turtles It Ain't
Me Babe is a fantastic tune but happy together their number one hit from slightly later 1967 is
one of the classic American pop hits I found the 1960s wraps up
to mount the
American response to this
popular music probably
the place that we always go
1955 and 59th and especially that. Between 59 and 63 a show coming out of Philadelphia
hosted by dick Larkin I
groups Drifters Benny King people like
them well NS 60s continued these
kinds of variety shows devoted to youth music I started to spring up all over the place the first
one of American Bandstand
current tax would appear on shindig what's interesting for our
story at least is that the show that it replaced on
essentially the same kind of variety show gear data kind of teen pop audience the one that's most important
mr. Tambourine Man Like a Rolling Stone and that was one called where the action is the reason
why where the
there usually associated with the sea around the Pacific Northwest and that
they had recorded version of Louie Louie not
too long after the kingsman 2 but with a kingsmans album by The Kingsmen song they
what they would do their gimmick would be they would wear American Revolutionary
War outfits complete with the three-cornered hats in the little buckle shoes in the stockings in
the show was filmed a big hits for
them just like me from 66 kicks from 66 and hungry from 66
the biggest of these talk about the influence of TV perhaps the biggest figure for
laali song I'm a Believer we already talked about being written by Neil Diamond number one hit in 1966
Sunday written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King bro building
summer of 1967 that's some pretty serious chart domination
after the
day one of his songs Different Drum by Linda
70s but I think it's fun just to kind
of see what developed we've got
a cartoon show
chimps from the television show that they be in the night in Fallout called Lancelot
heartthrob from that. Bobby Sherman been a
being the first concept album it's hard to talk about groups did did did most
teen teen hits bubblegum music ended up getting getting
a lot of beer play and
a lot of time and ask them radio which began to develop in
time when yes and
this week we talked about the music of
in the middle of the decade there few things so before we actually get into the consideration
of Motown stacks and
James Brown that I want to talk to you about your so that we can
talk about the issue of race and and how it
plays into a lot of what we're talking about here
mean there's probably no issue it in American culture at
signals especially a guy like me obviously a white
can have their own views on it but fortunately for us we don't really have to
worry so much about that because what we're really talking about is the history of
black pop a zit seen through
the lens of rock and roll and it's probably fair to
say that rock and roll is a style of music primarily directed
That by the time we get
week is talk about black pop in the 60s but I
make the the the admission or
or professors will take me up on this that what we really need is
a text book that deals with the history of black pop in his own contacts not the
of on this side of the
stories are coming in where they seem to be interesting to us from a
from a perspective centered on
Rock but rather a perspective
deals with black pop is being
the central thing and maybe thinks of rock is peripheral are Jazz's prefer older Country Western
involved in in this music in our discussions of it up we've already seen how this
plays a place out in our discussion of Music in the 1950s and before the
had so we've already
seen a kind of segregation and some of the kinds of sensitive issues
in America for those of you taking the
courses taking the course outside of the United States so let's
talk about having said that let's talk about what some of the issues
are to focus on this week the new black
pop that were talking about that were the
two parallels the rise of the British Invasion in
the American response spots in the middle of decade arises from True principal
sources there's Motown coming out
all kinds of steps are taken
its crossover Tendencies with
the music of Southern Soul awesome just referred to as a shorthand
is Stacks out of Memphis and they talk about that music is being more unabashedly black
somehow or the music on the stacks level
somehow blacker than
install the circles now at the same time you got James
how is it
sometimes as much success is a
lot of the Motown artists to some people
would say we're making concessions to to White a selfie an overview
of what we're going to talk about let's move
to our first US Pacific lecture now and we'll talk about the music of Motown
we're going to talk about the music of Motown now or hitsville USA as
Motown called itself and then
came to be called Motown was
a record label established by Berry
Gordy Jr in Detroit in 1959 Berry Gordy Jr is a very important
business in
the country and so our record is
there a record label that started out as a kind of a a small Indie
label and in a lot of
ways Regional Indie label I became a very big of force in the world of poppies
music and that's partly because of the Excellence of the artists and other people
who were involved with him partly the division of Berry Gordy Jr who from
the very beginning had this idea as
we said in the opening lecture of taking a
group's Berry Gordy Jr a little bit about his
personal story. He was actually a
Jr started a record store was first foray into music of one of his first forays was
a record store that specializes in jazz
so much in jazz and so he adjusted but kept it in his mind that
the money is in pop Berry Gordy Jr continues to
stay involved with music by writing
songs I started writing songs with Jackie Wilson
for Jackie Wilson the singer petite from 1957
was one of those records it was released lonely teardrops I
7 and 1958 and
that's why I love you was a number to R&B chart hit in 1959
these were all records that featured Berry Gordy
Jr as a songwriter often together working with other people there's a that has
Leiber of the Libre installer songwriting production team and said that he really wanted to
bloom in the sixties as we talked about a couple of weeks ago and Jerry Leiber said you
Gordy Jr took that advice
very much to heart and so established Motown
in 1959 and Motown is in many ways a
parallel structure to the brill building structure that we talked about a few weeks ago with
lot of those people were moving to the West Coast Don Kirshner people like that were focused in
brill building model establishing in
Detroit really that's what Motown really should have hits hits hits
hits tried and so very much
based on this Motown of bondage Brill building
a model some of the early hits did Berry Gordy had on Motown records worth
a song by Barrett Strong called
group with please mr. Postman that was number one on both the
pop and R&B charts in 1961 Saab big hit
for a very small Regional label fantastic success for him by The Contours at a track called do
you love me which was number one in the R&B charts and
an awful lot like The Isley Brothers from 1962 and so at the beginning he sort of following the
lead of others Berry Gordy has now let's talk
a little bit more
about this idea of crossing over and and pursuing a
white audience we we set a bit about it as well in the first video
this is the idea that you know
if you just as a business person look at the lay of the land
early on that you know as I said from
had artist many of whom came from
shape the artist and
shape the image of Motown to make it acceptable for cross so
might call the etiquette and choreography of
what was different about Motown and people have you no love to talk about Motown is
being some kind of an assembly line and this
of these these big
the artist called the
do and Maxine Powell job you're certain degree wish to work with all of the
he hired a guy by the name of Charlie at cholly
Atkins who had been a Broadway Dance choreographer and got him to do
brill building Model A Berry Gordy had a whole group of songwriters
the records that could be good and
those that were really excellent so all these different song
writers and producers were vying
an artist they got to keep that artist when
the baby came to began to fail he give somebody else a shot of that artist to keep
they were called the Funk Brothers and they were Detroit's
version of LA's Wrecking
response which really starts to launch in the summer of 1965 number I talked
about folk-rock mr. Tambourine Man Dylan and in
all of that last week the early successes at Motown that's
The Contours Smokey Robinson and the Miracles Smokey Robinson
not only a
single producer at Motown but also an artist in his own write his group had a
the evening he decides you know this song
piano player who was on the session so be recording
guy is so sort of consumed with the business that
he's going to release a record he decides he's
for for 1964 number one hit on the pop charts my guy now as
we talked about the rest of these artists I
want to start by talking about just the artist that were produced by the holland-dozier-holland song
writing a production team because in many ways HDH holland-dozier-holland where one of
the birds The Beatles are
the Supremes if you're
1964 with where did our love
and see about me for 1964 Stop in the Name of Love and back in my arms again
for 1965 and continue to
have a fantastic success throughout the the rest of the 1960s of course Diana Ross going on
if you have a fantastic solo
with holland-dozier-holland during this year's to four cops so he
1954 and
sign to Chess Records in Chicago but they moved to Motown and 1964 featuring Levi Stubbs on lead
vocals the arrangements for HDH often featured
temptations Martha and the Vandellas some of the other artists if you're looking for a representative examples of
the Four Tops with probably a couple that you really should check out baby I
need your Lovin a number 11 it for 1964 one of
the pop and R&B charts in 1965 standing in the shadows of was
also number one on both charts in
1966 so some fantastic HDH Four Tops music from the mid-1960s HDH also work with Martha
and the Vandellas know Martha Reeves the lead singer of that group I had been a professional singer was
that they didn't get
a hit and then he would switching to try to get another producer another song
the Temptation when I thought about the Springs I said they were originally formed as the primes were
he was the guy who was in charge of choreography for everybody
things we think about them Temptations Temptations crab Rafi we have to think of that as a
to coasters Brian Wilson singing
falsetto in those Beach Boys records and there's Frankie Valli singing
11 hit written by Smokey Robinson Cruisin by
Smokey Robinson Smokey went
on to have a hit with the more heads with the group including my girl which
Norman Whitfield and whitfields security sent the Temptations for
1966 so Temptations again another great
example of some of the Motown artists in the mid-60s Marvin Gaye a fantastic
singer Motown producers producing
several hits Pride and Joy from 1963 with with Mickey Stevenson how
sweet to be loved by you for 1955 was
a hit that HDH at dip with him ain't that peculiar for 1965 was done with Smokey Robinson
we'll talk more about Marvin Gaye when we
talk about black pop in the
to that work would have to have an artist play a real role in producing their own record
Motown singing and
playing the harmonica initially not really thought
or playing the harmonica his first big hit
uptight everything's alright from 1966 and other big hit for Stevie Wonder I number one on the
R&B chart number one on the pop chart and I said was Marvin Gaye
Stevie Wonder will be somebody we really want
to talk about in part
figures in that in the history of
black popular music in the 1970s 1960s Motown turn
Southern Soul enter to start a discussion let's take a look
King The Drifters a lot of those kinds of records and so
a lot of those groups signed to Atlantic Records but for now what's happening
at the Atlantic Records is there starting to make the transition from Sweet Soul
to head in this Direction when he produces an artist
named Solomon Burke. He's working also with Bert Berns we've talked about Bert
Berns a couple of times 1/10 Atlantic they're having a number to R&B hit in
63 with if you need me that Solomon Burke number one R&B hit in 1965 with got to
Atlantic they can have pretty good
success if they find R&B hits that have been Regional hits and license that we talked about
this idea of Licensing its National side
lantic could Rebrand a song by the licensing
rights off of off of one of
these smaller labels and really but make make something
these these be re-releases has another
possible way of a cup of bringing out I hit records with Atlantic Records
and he starts to get into a relationship with Stax Records are from Memphis ice tax was formed in
1960 by Jim Stewart and
his sister Estelle Axton so you've got the stewardess
nasty part of it and the accident is the expert wpst and act together you get stacked basis I
say in Memphis Tennessee they came to
to the stacks studios in Memphis and
Stack's Nursery
usually starts with
stacks the Stax volt refers to
a whole sort of style it
in the same kind of organized way other Berry Gordy I had done we had Isaac Hayes and
the guitar duck done on the base and Al Jackson Jr on the
and into the 1950s also and
turn our attention now to some of the performers at stacked
let's take a minute to take stock of some of the Styles we've been talking about this weekend in
Sergeant Pepper in the summer of 67 American response to
success really start of parallel that of the British Invasion having even having kids before the British Invasion by
continuing to go strong through that. Seemingly
unaffected by the British
in page and stacks who
continuous with what was happening at the 60 so if
you take groups like
The Shirelles and The Ronettes and the crystals and
york-based to detroit-based the rise of stacks however
in pop really should have brought in the market for black Popeye the
second half of the decade because of stacked music really brought in
I said before we say statue really sure of talking about Southern Soul
because a lot of this music wasn't really recording the sack Studios or or
Memphis at all one
important thing to note is that old
school music business practices really remained in
force in a lot of this new music and the other roles of producers the song
letters especially and black pop during this. And I think it's also
important as I said in a couple of different
a change things but it didn't
it didn't force black music off the charts I would say Motown and Stax did not react as
much to
the British Invasion as white pop did Sobe many
are the similarities between
Motown and Stax because as I said before a couple of times in this
video they've always been sort of setup is almost like sir of Polar Opposites are you know
and whole question of whether or not Stax music is somehow blacker
than Motown musical and if
devoted song writers
Studio Bands
A lot of it is is is very similar between the two so is Stacks
couple folks were white were involved in
the moat an operation but he was it
of the other kind of other kind of certain facts surrounding this it's true
shown up emotional time recordings of there's a
the white OfferUp audience in effect
Motown record sounded very produced very controlled ironically a lot like the way Atlantic Records
and looser Motown was obviously more
pop-oriented and concerned
with mainstream crossover somewhere
think about this tax Motown thing I just go to turn all
these different variables around and think about develop your own opinion on whether
Motown to think of them as somehow selling out their
in his music makes hardly any concessions
get to cross over the James Brown is
black Papa certainly going to history of American poppy music in the twentieth century
his early career James Brown was born in South Carolina but raised in southern Georgia he had
Regional success in the mid-1950s with his group The Fabulous Flame
Five Little
were they were out
of Georgia you knowing out of the region and you know how much much bigger
at gigs that have been booked for Richard James Brown's first big hits up please please please number 6
on the R&B charts on 9th in 1956 Brown was
signed to King records
in Cincinnati which was
run by Syd Nathan and I had a very long-standing relationship
with King records in Cincinnati and
in that style when we get into the 1960s at before we
a pretty doggone good performance for 1963 I
in our next and final week we're going to talk about the music in psychedelica of
which is generally thought of as the time from about 1966 through
1969 the very
end of the 60s I call this chapter in
the book I think I X and big ideas and put I say
that somewhere I'm not really quite sure where I would like to review how we
got to this point we talked
about the British Invasion The Beatles
is the idea of mainstream vs. subculture we talked about subcultures music musical
Scholars like to talk about this topic
an awful lot because a subculture means and something that's going on in a musical scene that's a
start of off the mainstream radar
idea is what we're going to call the growth of musical
in the idea of higher
two ways music music could be used to enhance the LSD
but creating
what makes up this hippie aesthetic of music you can begin to trace this
musical ambition all the way back at least to the The Drifters There Goes My Baby from 1959
push the envelope help us further understand how music can be so I can download
not only share the same listen in many cases but they share the same label Capitol Records
in Los Angeles at least in
were on the same label with the The Beach Boys Capital
out of Los Angeles and I
only shared common listeners they not only sure, but they
also shared a lot of other characteristics that are maybe sometimes overlooked as they begin to sort of pushed
success to continue to push the envelope sand experiment they both use the recording studio was
a kind of compositional tool
them use classical features in their music drawing both from
some extent with both groups I turn now
to the music of the Beach Boys how it became increasingly ambitious
from about the mid-1960s through 1967 or so
worth of stuff to make up 1 album that maybe lasts maybe 30 5 minutes top
the arrival of the Beach Boys serve more experimental artistic approach is Pet Sounds from mid 1966 that
be nice and most especially I track called God only knows
they that went on to do good vibrations in late
1966 which was released after the Beatles album revolver which have been released in August of 1966 Good
of trippy a kind of Peace we're talking about late 1966
now and Brian had
intended to do was to release an album called smile it
was even advertised for releasing early 1967 but didn't seem
and Strawberry Fields as a double sided
single the Smile Project
falls apart and the Beach Boys instead release an album called smiley smile in August 1967 which
was released after sergeant pepper which had been placed in June of 1967 so by comparing the releases
years we talked about this a couple of weeks ago it's a fantastic coordinates
you can see the kind
than front Brian Wilson side I don't know for sure that turn out
to the The Beatles themselves and what
the Magical Mystery Tour does it contain the video for I Am The Walrus and Paul McCartney said a
number of times he defends it on the value of that also in
about the Beatles career management issues
which are now to San Francisco and the idea of
Haight-Ashbury being the heart and center of the Psychedelic movement in the late 1960s one
topic that we can engage that I've I've
home so there in the in the area and
of what psychedelic music is an an
hour how music can be psychedelic The Grateful Dead were formed as
a group called
The warlocks and by 1965 they were playing around doing Rolling Stones Tunes
they were doing them Chicago Electric
to find one that doesn't have the Grateful Dead on at they were they were playing all the time
electronic Compass you knew something about that and of course he
was also involved with the tape Center which
when we talk about San Francisco to note that there were really two kinds of scenes around San Francisco
University of california-berkeley who are usually thought of as the Berkeley radicals who really wanted to see
of bridge the gap between those was Country Joe and the Fish Country Joe did both the kind of
his album from 1967 the band's album from 1967 called electric music for mind and body according
and differences that the compare and contrast discussion with this is I think really quite fascinating for the
first. Upton 1967 will get the same kind of thing in London that is mainstream groups
of music that we that we know that that makes
the world psychedelic Center and his job really has to be like Ken
of the Psychedelic scene or a group called The Pink Floyd that was
the original version of Pink Floyd lead by Syd Barrett they had to early singles
that were important in the UK the Pink Floyd led by
Floyd that they refused to
nice video we talked about the London Underground scene and the the groups that were more
Stones follow the groups
that's that's very freeing to
are on Beggars Banquet Street Fighting Man Sympathy for the Devil really start to
and Eric Clapton the Jimi Hendrix experience and cream these two groups basically the same kind of
circuit playing with people like Little Richard and with the Isley Brothers one story that's often
been a bass player before he must have been a folk singer playing acoustic guitar
think about that three-piece group Jimmy Mitch
and know their blues and pop numbers are probably best
really engages in the Psychedelic use of the recording studio as a
the home of country and western music after 1945 are the popularity of
country western music grew to the
about that in this particular video probably a
place for us
that was particularly appropriate we played a match on on on regular Network radio so if
I say country and
how much territory you could
cover with her radio station if you're you're broadcasting get this frequency how high a
power you can broadcast and all that.
can broadcast at a certain power level so they're not covering each other cuz you got to station on
the day but in the evening shirt and stations were allowed to crank up
up in just south of of
he was growing up at back in
the the late 1930s and so this is this is Fantastic Beasts
popular and so you could get a short show maybe 30 minutes maybe 60 Minutes on one of
in syndication for I think it was 30 minutes in 1933 so you can actually can I hear a
covering the grand old opera and it wasn't
too long before the Grand Ole Opry came to be thought of as the country radio
people coming into Nashville Tennessee and so
it's a convenient place to have a recording studio if you're doing country
western music record it's a convenient place to have a publishing house if your publisher who
publishes he's the
song some country western music it's even a good place to have a guitar store or
to be a booking agent any of these got to think so Nashville starts to become headquarters for
country western music mostly because
so many of the top positions are coming
through to perform on the Grand Ole Opry now we pick up us
a story that we we left off
from one of the other videos about how constructing how you can construct images and
it's fairly well a great I think among Scholars
who study the history of country western music that the image of
the Grand Ole Opry was pretty much
constructed to represent what people thought of country music or country people that the day that
is that no matter what these people
who participate in the Grand Ole Opry were actually like in real life when they were onstage they kind
of played the rube they kind of played it down they played
into almost a caricature of what country life
was so you have people like
but on
the late for his early 1950s it's clear the
and a wig and this
guy thinks he's playing the role of a cranky old banjo playing grandpa but
constructing this image of country music as being a particular kind of thing projecting this image and it
was very very effective
at doing so what are other ways that country and western music came to be popular in
this country besides the radio one of them has to do
with the fact that a lot of people were thrown together in
were crashing airplane into boats and things like that say to hell with Roosevelt to hell
with Babe Ruth to hell with Roy Acuff. Country singer people were starting to embrace this music where
is my back to their cities after they they
left the service on the war was over
if they develop a taste for that music they
wanted to hear it and that's where the development of country music in the urban
areas it takes it takes his foot hole so Nashville becomes the central place
after 1945 and as I said before that's mostly because
of the Grand Ole Opry and you've got your recording to do in your Publishers
I got him a Fred Rose who had been a New York
publisher but as The Story Goes his wife was originally from Nashville and
sort of New York music business statistics station to town whether they were
very fortunate that the song Tennessee
Waltz which I mentioned a couple of videos ago from 1950 sung by Patti Page was actually owned by
Hank Williams Hank
fact his first song to come out
Cheatin Heart and cold cold heart so to show Hank
I'm sorry we haven't got more time to talk about this it's the birth of bluegrass
music very rarely in
the history of Music are we able to say we know exactly where I style started and
got mandolin you've got banjo you got acoustic guitar you've got fiddle and
in fact there's
just one microphone is a kind of shining of Technology clock time extra measures while the different
solo has come to the come to the microphone there's a little bit
of extra walking time
that's that's bigger than midgets everybody can get from the microphone hit him anyways bluegrass music is
all as it sounds like it's kind of the Bebop Jazz of country
western it's where the players go who really want to
Scruggs and a banjo playing that he does that 505 touring band of Mike becomes really the
sound of bluegrass music even today is also in that group is Lester Flatt after they played after
Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played with Bill Monroe for a while they
started their own group and that's really where
they had most of their Fame as Flatt & Scruggs if you want to listen to a
on Sun Records in 1954 was his
that had come from from the movie industry television
was increasingly moving to Los Angeles
eventually settled in the
settled in the Altamont Speedway I not too far outside of San Francisco Michael long who had
organized Woodstock help them out with the organizing the Rolling Stones were
those particular Hells Angels were not right ones for that and a guy ended up getting killed right in
front of the stage really on camera for
subculture into the mainstream in
Middle America or something I call you know can I buy
the 70s separated out into specialty kinds of styles if you can think of Pink Floyd's
up to this point we've talked about the growth of mainstream pop music
in the. Up to 1955 and we talked about the development of country music up to
way of describing a market category it's
a way of describing a
demographic rhythm and blues was
thought of as music made by
and consumed
by African-Americans who plays music from
and for black listeners and musicians the inside rhythm and blues as
a sort of Music hologist It Isn't So Much a stylistic label
but it's a troubled one because
it's his first definition seems to have to do with who's making it was consuming it
as opposed to the musical qualities that it has of course the mystical qualities are are
the side of the kind of the normative Market
may be Poppin these two other Niche markets country western music
which was really called hillbilly records and Rhythm Blues which really
called which were originally called race records and
it's important
it certainly is accepting it and trying to exploit it
things charged with divider for the merchants use and not really
an record store
so they could know what records were hot so
they could make sure they had the records that
everybody seem to want to buy had plenty
there's probably no likelihood that white positions
and what customers are not coming to
can do this blues music on
weekends maybe sell some records and so one of the most famous of
these musicians who discovered during this. Is Robert Johnson another one of these guys who died very
young died in 1938 at a very young age he's mostly associated with
they'll be another person along with that that the singer playing the guitar dude playing
Singer wants to add an extra b or
don't have to worry
about coordinating with other musicians so it's a very expressive sometimes very raw a sound and
for the birth of rock music one of the things that we have to
keep in mind as we think about how this music originally associated with R&B
culture starts or Black Culture starts to make its way into urban areas is the migration occurred in
this country from the rural South to the
thing would get on the train and
go to the end of the stop wherever it landed North and that place North might be
Chicago it might be Detroit it might be Baltimore might
be New York to
that were available in the big cities that was especially the
case during the second world war where everybody was being
about a time when things are pretty
which are mostly
Regional mostly in certain
cities so we can talk about places like Chicago and New York
and Memphis and Los Angeles and and
talk about Regional radio now A couple of
years ago I talked about how when the radio audience migrated from Radio
to television
it left a lot of
openings in radio because the the the syndicated programming the station for using didn't disappear immediately but
had they stations started changing their orientation rather than being a local affiliate for
it turned out that one of those groups they
could sell advertising to was the black community
I am that's that's a fantastic story of this chained up
this moving to television making
opportunities for
and the rise of R&B there at least whether they're probably
with the style of Chicago Electric Blues
that we here in artists like Bo Diddley Muddy Waters
Howlin Wolf and also the first records of Chuck Berry which
like Chess Records you have to figure that Chess
Records consists of Phil and Leonard Chess and maybe a secretary who
do their their office work by day and then at
they were able to get increasingly better facilities but these these independent labeled I
the labels wall in fact there's a certain kind
about that a little bit later now in distinction to Chess Records which was
a nice chest recordings are usually appreciate it
aspect of
way they sent it but it became the mark of what a
chess blues record with sound like now in distinction inter contrasted
to R&B traditional in the sense that that would be Arrangements done
for tunes of the artist would come in Reading charts that would be professional session
kind of make stuff up as they went along this is
really kind of an imitation of what made
didn't want him sending rugged they didn't want anybody say what a fantastic Ross and a particular
particular about an Atlantic
about an Atlantic had a guy by the name of Tom Dowd doing all the engineering at sound
get some great sounds of fact we talked before about Les Paul
and that first 8-track recording machine
years before the Beatles Sergeant Pepper I'm so they were really concerned about sound quality
Ray Charles was on
independent recording a guy his
thing was he would go out in court all kinds of things usually keep
recording you know choir sang church music
and that kind
with Ike Turner later of Ike and Tina Turner Revue on piano that
record was
actually recorded by Sam Phillips in
his room studios in such but then least two Chess
having signed Elvis Presley in 1954 and then having sold Elvis's contract to RCA other artists Seattle
head of our story other important Indie labels
workers were recorded by Dave Bartholomew down in New Orleans. Records in Tennessee
as being exclusively appealing to White artist Pat Pat Boone actually had
a bunch of hits on the
nationally and so you had these fantastic major labels that were focusing almost entirely on mainstream pop and that
left room for these independent labels to focus on R&B mostly not
too much or harassed in any way by
the major labels until rock and roll hit
and until
these R&B labels started to sell big numbers of Records then
all of a sudden the majors took notice and they were going to start fighting back but that gets
we talked in the last video about the rise of rhythm and
blues in the. Leading
up to 1955 are birth of rock are specially the time between 1945 and
1955 and the
role of independent labels as they were able to create music that people in
could drive with records in his trunk to put them in
a record store each week major labels on the other hand had distribution networks
that could get recordings out across the country and relatively short. A timer for most of them. Up
they could you know sell products and you may
think we'll that's a that's a kind of a cynical weight
product and it seems like a sensible thing to say but that's the way that
not such a good thing but on the other hand you can think
could go into quite innocently to buy something where they could be
turned away simply because they were black the
restaurants where
they might go the way they might want to get a meal but they will be turned
they could go to that business Buda restaurant or
a theater or or a store or something that you
said these radio stations even though they were about selling
in that they were helping folks out from that point of view at least that's it
that featured exclusively black Physicians R&B
All of these DJ's wear
black but
they sounded
black on the air and so did Alan freed in 1951 in fact listeners blacklisters would come down to
didn't know you were white well this just
Cleveland to New York
w n w i n s changing his he was the original show was called the moon dog
and roll well I hope that maybe the fact is that because the
radio R&B Regional radio
folks took advantage of that
they started to play a lot of us by music because
black folks work now moving up from the rural areas
was that white teenagers could
also hear those stations because
just about this time radios were starting to become portable
you can have a radio in your car right you could get away from where
into the clubs for this music is playing but you
show that they think is going to be at ease going to it's going to have
all black artist I think it's going to be attended by

and we could hypothetically Floyd them all the way over here from London to perform especially with Nancy is
be talking about that you might reasonably expect or
Thursday to be the same person as the
person who's sitting here lecturing to you today these are questions about the nature of personal identity pretty
thing I need to explain is this there's roughly speaking two ways
to do a class especially an introductory class like this and approach
is the case whether or not we know that
the obvious reaction the
natural reaction the universal reaction is to face the prospect of death with fear and despair mentioned
rationally morally Justified the common picture is pretty much mistaken from start to end that's at least my goal
that's that's my that's what I'm
going to be doing extensive course I believe the views I believe
and I hope at the end of the semester you'll agree with me because I think they're true and
you at the end of
arguments on each side of these various issues
thinking about what we can know or make sense of with regard to death using our reasoning capacities will
will be trying to think about death from a rational standpoint one
your church teaches you and and
the readings on the syllabus simply say the author you know and there's
sections will meet for 50 minutes you of course we'll have a single time
each one of you have a single title to be different times to discussion sections meat
this week for the first time that the Place Apartments just switched
those discussion section x yet but as I think next week when
chances are pretty good that there's 25 or 50 other students in the class who don't understand it either
to have some Meo close intimate conversation
between 150 and 180 how many students there are here that's not going to
on a normal day meet outside and continue to talk with however
many of you want to do
odd that the! Actually is not hard to come by no don't worry is that
those of us who are harder greater-than-average if
greater-than-average will never feel guilty and toughen up and saw the result would be a constant push
but they will grade under my supervision and in
keeping with the standards that I asked them
to grade what's up
when you're pissed off about your grades a person to take it up with pick up
excellent work for a first class in philosophy this is
an introductory class it does not presuppose any background in philosophy still
to get an A you got to show some Flair for the subject you got to show not only
time doing it I mean you had bull sessions right
with your high school friends or any of your college dorm or what-have-you but you haven't done
the paper significantly outweigh
you in your initial papers will get lower grades than you
probably ever gotten before in your life wanted to warn you about that no I
got the ability to do
do decent work in
matter but I'm going to fail all of you but it's more
to be honest with you you're smart
questions that they raised and you need to come to discussion section
then prepared to
discuss this week's set of issues you need to listen to what your classmates are saying and
doing what the section is there for philosophers
you'll have to read are not there's not
about this being ninja intro classes that it's introductory in
should end of class by saying you will believe the lie in

don't know how to give it to you next topic grades one-hit

you'll be back on Thursday
what would it be for a thing like that to survive the death
the question of survival can be asked about that very simple case is the
person who's going to be lecturing to you on Tuesday the very same person as
spend some time talking about examples that I think we would not find puzzling and work our
way back up to the
entity the car and asking
obviously through space since cars take up
have more fats at least that's what the question is metaphysically
Train the car stages are the metaphysical fundamental things and Anna car something extended
through time is glued together like a sandwich
from the car stages don't worry about what's the relevant metaphysical glue for cars what's
really Pryor is the car itself at talking
temporal example the car and end are those exactly
that person's
got to be the very same person as the person you're looking at Naga thinking about now what
Time space-time warm As Eva stages got to be glued together in the right way you can't
possibility suppose that over the weekend at 3 a.m. Saturday night
Sunday morning while I'm
asleep God replaces my soul with a different soul Cooks It Up in the body there's
that soul that Replacements all all of
my memories all of my beliefs all of my desires all my intentions somebody
whatever it is says
got to have the same soul and we just stipulated
philosophy last week but he'd be
jolynda Sally whatever
every hour on the hour every minute every second
suggestion that there's
this logically contradictory about yourself could this really be what personal
identity is all about there being no way at all to tell
what it meant notice this is not an argument that Souls don't
the same bodies been around even though you didn't do it you could
have snuck into my house watch
turn the body back on same body same person
come Judgment Day that's
they're still gears and watches imagines
an old stop watching and he cleans all the pieces in Boston and polishes them and then reassembles the
that is my watch
example that's due to Peter Van inwagen he's contemporary metaphysician teachers at
that I'd be saying something false
Day were to come and God
if that's the way bodily Resurrection would work I don't know if it's the algaecide I don't know what
the question was what
new person but strictly speaking we don't think it is literally a whole new person and
even a
for that mean about a percent change that's clearly too much change
of some small percentage from eating not
a problem change from the somewhat larger percentage of
losing a fair bit of weight doesn't seem to
hand goes right the very
not whether it's just only made it up but the parts to be true question
alive so this is a proof
heart in here I've gotten a heart transplant it's still me suppose we
in Jones's brain
brain just like follow the soul was the answer if we believe in the soul theory of personal identity
to think no follow the brain
a fan of the brain Theory you got a brain transplant what's really
happened to somebody else has gotten the Torso transplant follow the
all the wires the right way the thing wakes up who is it it's Jones follow the brain and
more particularly follow however much of the brain it takes to have enough of the brain there
to still give you the memories
Arnold Souls we don't have to say that
and goals
and Ambitions and fears are all the same even if a
the secret to personal identity on this new proposal isn't sameness of body it's sameness of personality now
literally the same brain If
that we got the same personality than normal case and put some physical explanation of where
the person my house is the personality but for all that
the key to personal identity is same personality also accept
personality theory of personal identity
can be accepted by physicalists and it can be accepted by duelist top
just us to keep score right now we've got three basic theories of personal
identity on the table the soul
a trash collector that was my first chosen profession
to be a logician when I was a teenager I wanted to study symbolic logic sorry I
guess it when I gave that up right so my memories my desires were changing but
they all changed gradually I lost some old memories
fiber stretches all the way across the room even if
overlapping fibers shorten fibers and but most of the fibers
as long as it's not abrupt scissors and
cut out a foot in the middle let me see the right kind of
in real life they go hand-in-hand in ordinary cases at least same body same
it were so
which one do you want to not
question it is from that
and what I'm going to do is and I've got you and I've
you will wake up in Linda's body he'll be going to be something there
that that
over here we got Shelley's body but in a Linda's personality so Linda think
I'm going
intuition I've got when I think
want that to happen to me this
one being tortured nobody's thinking to himself all I'm Shelly Kagan in horrible
pain so I want this one to be tortured and I've got about the case now
if you got that same intuition think about the implications of that intuition you're saying that I
got my personality my memories of growing up in Chicago becoming a
Shelly Kagan personality over here this is me that follows then that this intuition suggests that
any desire to the whole thing wipe clean complete
know there she is I've been reading her Psychology by looking at her brain
up in Pennsylvania and you'll remember Linda's family and like Linda you'll want to be an author
me when I think about this second case that's my intuition I
think about the implications of this second case for the theory of
personal identity if I don't want meat if I don't want this thing
give us two different diametrically opposed answers on the very same question 1
the torturing and ticket goes in there Shelly Kagan body over
here with Linda's personality and
suggestion suggestion was this when the mad scientist put my person
out if she'll take a personality onto Linda's
body he had
to modify Linda's brain and modify Linda's brain
the computer personalities a little bit like a program that's running on
the computer but we have to have not just a generic program but the
specific data files and databases and
on the Shelly Kagan computer but it's still the very same computer
up but still where is
I I'm
in horrible pain I wish it stop I wonder whether I'll ever see Linda's husband
felt in mine over here we've got something that's going to
that your lump of Flesh doesn't have its neurons hurt or making sure that the person
these two theories it seems as though we need
raising a certain philosophical objection to the personality theory implication that
wrong thing to say about the case we should reject personality View black
believe the Earth is round that's not enough to make somebody else to me the
same overall personality which is a very big complicated set of
beliefs and desires and Ambitions
Emperor he doesn't remember being defeated by the British at any of those memories doesn't
the personality theory personality theory says to be Napoleon you got to have Napoleon's personality but David Smith
objection then says even if this guy had all of Napoleon's memories believes desires personality still wouldn't be
Napoleon so the personality theories got to go what
Michigan the last
fiction stories here
thinking maybe that would be the right thing to say guy
over there didn't have same experiences that
Napoleon personality through and through well
or quasi
memories or whatever we should call them
theory but we can now treat me worried in a slightly different way okay
time I
happen but if it did happen to could happen
want to say that we're going to run out of possibilities as
splittings and branchings nobody none of them is me show where the original personality theory said same personality
that's good enough for being the same person the new version throws
throws in a no
time thought he was Shelly Kagan believe he was Professor philosophy I think I'm
to me that's what the personality theory says so I
can come over the break a couple days came back it's still
yeah this person here Nas got the same
in this guy or that stage in this stage if we prefer to talk about it
fact about what happening someplace else but if we accept
the no branching rule we're saying whether or not we got identity depends
on what's Happening elsewhere with the no branching rule
all these problems for the personality theorist. Body theorists fans of
see how easy it is to duplicate personality
meaning to
these totally implausible no branching rules
we can avoid all of that if we've become body theorists we'll
imagine that over the weekend the mad scientist copied my memories beliefs desires fears
doesn't seem plausible and turn to the personality theory to say that he is Shelly Kagan and everyone here
today in Michigan right if the one in Michigan so they can but this one's not after all those
last week's lecture just like I remembered last week's lecture no
me to say that neither of us is Shelly Kagan but
that was here lecturing to you last week that's what the personality theory Mary case but in the
science fiction story where there's a duplicate it says if
is branching the no branching rule comes in neither of them is Shelly Kagan
the personality with no branching rule avoid the problem what to say about duplicates by
these things now you're not willing to except maybe you need to reject the personality theory
the fans of the body view typically are laughing they say what a dumb Siri
and couldn't split
the song spare torsos where the Torso has come from well you had some living people but
they had very rare brain diseases and their brain suddenly liquefies and I we got some spare torsos
fission case the body says the body Theory says in the fission case there's splitting these
branching so neither of them is going to end up being
the problem of duplication by adding the no branching rule but of
don't know the answer to that of course she would consider both possibilities so
so that's what happened
so that's what happened
can run through all the possibilities yourself right we couldn't say well
it's left me and not writing but there's nothing in the soul theory that supports that
Kagan Soul then righty is Shelly Kagan and Lefty's The
Imposter stop looking at the situation from the outside we might be unable to
tell which
one is really Shelly Kagan because we won't be able to
views here had their difficulties maybe that's the difficult in your prepared to accept what's
God destroyed my soul and put in a New Soul Charlie Hagen die
things with the relevant soul so
arguments for believing in the soul in the
survive the operation exposed we didn't before the brain transfers all the time and the following thing always happened
transfer the entire
the existence of the Soul if we found
you find a no branching rule
hard to believe if both views are stuck with it when we're stuck
better theory of personal identity answer I'm not sure over the
we can sort of see why that personality
emerges through karmic
cause and effect anyway that are a function of what I was like in my life again because
the key to personal identity if there's no similar personality no memories no police no retrievable memories of
past lives who
cares that it's me if you can feel the force of that thought then
surgery and implant that
knuckle bone in somebody else's body and that
the possibility of bear survival
of the scrum clean erased Soul you see that survival wasn't really everything you wanted what
normally be inclined to run together we've been asking ourselves what does it take from me to survive for
Amnesia while none the less it still your soul continuing but the soul is
brighter than having been
scrubbed clean get a brand new personality new set of memories new set of desires new set of beliefs
your brain you're still
supposed personality view of personal identity was correct with that then give us
not just personal survival but what
get older and older and older and I get some new memories and some new
back to what it was like to be 4 or 3
and suppose that I
all gradual slow
that's still in me that's going to be around six hundred
tail end of an evolving personality I
might be that the whole question we've been focusing on what is it take to survive it
transplant your personality into some new Angel body but if
afterwards there won't be anything that
clearer about what people
are and
well roughly speaking I
after your death the bad news is you'll be a
no longer functioning as a person I
I still exist indeed I'm alive but I'm not a person being a
identity the problem of personal identity seem to have built into it the assumption that whatever it
personal identity but just a problem of identity turn
with my beliefs memories desires fears values goals ambitions
if I just am my personality then I don't exist in Phase G because there's nothing there to be
me nothing with my personality according to personality
theory I don't exist but I'm alive that seems
like a very unpalatable combination of use how can I be alive if I don't even exist so
my body
body being alive on the other in
functioning not rash is
happen to have in Phase a the stage of my existence before I become a person of
samsara hard to
it's a good long time to any kind of mental processing occurs
at all it's on the personality theory I did not exist
when that fertilized egg came into being with me with the
egg and the sperm join that's still not
on the personality theory
clearly these issues are relevant for thinking about the morality of abortion I'm not going to pursue them
here but you can see how they beat
be hard cases about them very very early stages and another
great questions and I'm happy as custom with you further I don't want to pursue them here now what
a point to a different question that I think it's crucially important question might mind my unwillingness
to discuss them isn't a matter of my judgment that are unimportant just trying
to keep at least we on
a heart transplant or can you transplant a liver transplant
we have to ask who or what has the
right to life do
me the real question is
deeper sonified to have my personality destroyed if
straight forward you and say
me that's the question will turn to next time
you're not thinking you're not planning you're not communicating let's just suppose that seems
after all they were only temporarily not be functioning just like we are temporarily not
be functioning when we're asleep that
so the proposal that death is a matter of permanent cessation of P functioning versus temporary that
still alive take the dead will be resurrected on Judgement
of suspended animation and then the amazing
suppose we eventually learn how to do this with humans and now suppose we
how to draw that line so I'll leave that to you as a puzzle to work on on your
nothing especially mysterious especially unusual or hard to grasp about it but there
are a handful of claims of people make
able to go on vacations together and take classes together death is
something we all have to do by yourself that's the claim we
was the most common argument for this claim I think takes the following form people
inclined to think that way of thinking about the question is really confused of
trying to put yourself in the situation imaginatively of
what it's like to be
dead I start
by trying to strip off the parts of my car just like that I know I won't
everything else I mean there's nothing there to
describe when you're dead there's nothing happening on the inside To Be Imagined well should
due to any failure of imagination that's because there's nothing there to imagine her
conclude therefore that you can't believe you're going to be dead no
basically just running the argument I've just sketched for you when you
looks like you do but here's the Freudian argument
and said he thought it was a good one in the
the mistake I think
when people make the claim is not clear which of these things then got in mind but
were going to die that is undergo bodily death while you take out life insurance people
your body was going to die
why would you ever bother writing a will since
many people write
it and have to
to not believe that your body is going to die we're simply asking noting the
fact that there do seem to be cases where people are surprised to discover that their mortal no
problem. notice I presume that Ivan illich
had a will drawn I know Ivan illich had life insurance so we're
was going to die and yet the shocked and surprised that they said that
he's in the overcomes him when he actually has to face his mortality strongly suggest that he's reporting correctly
some such distinction if we're going to make sense of Ivan illich well let's suppose we've
tell stories Ivan illich is surprised to discover that he's going to die
of his mortality seems to shock him seems to surprise him
let's suppose many of us will behave this way the best explanation of behavior is to be found by
all the way down however we should put it if you really did
believe you were going to die the horror of that would lead you to start screaming
and just keep screaming forces example reminds us
seriously the thought that you were going I die you couldn't stop screaming but
of course nobody here is screaming from which we can conclude none of
us really do believe fundamentally
deep down that we're going to die that wouldn't be
crucial premise and of course we don't
have any good as
far as I can see we don't have any good reason to believe that crucial premise my
Tasco is there some other Behavior something else that should tip us off could tip
sort of experience or
suppose that this is true
done the reading of the Edwards paper that I signed you have a series of
I was rude truly ready to drop it and then I kid you not that very afternoon I came
across a quote I'll start for you in a second somebody say oh we all die alone and then
I think it was two days later a week later I came across another
quote thought it's
dies in a room
you wrap it
up in the language everyone dies alone if that's all you're
saying you're not saying anything interesting when
dies alone is supposed to say something special about death
it better not be that everyone does everything alone because it is whatever the relevance
of alone turns out to be really does everything alone
I put these conditions down because of course what I
wanted suggested although the sentence everyone dies alone the
possible interpretation the
most natural straightforward literal flat-footed interpretation
the death scene of Socrates Socrates drinks the hemlock and dies in
the presence of his friends and disciples Socrates does not die alone and of course we know that there
not like this is some sort of Cooperative joint
undertaking give
along and says I know everybody dies alone and dying is part of a joint undertaking is impossible just
possible in the case of joint suicide packs as
hero sacrifices himself so that the woman he looks well for
who's about to die just
to express that point in the language everyone dies alone but racket that at least found
right Michael where we're at we're looking for interpretations of the claim everyone dies alone and by now he's
is it true that everyone dies feeling
while they're sleeping such a person presumably is not feeling lonely
or alienated while he dies what
am I say okay what we met was anybody who said have a wake while
say that everybody dies feeling the
psychological feelings of
take care of the Sleep case that
would take care of the truck case is the claim
he's about to die he's drunk the hemlock he's sitting there
saying goodbye everybody he's doesn't seem
these things that one hears I think
we die and as you know I've defended
the particular
exist when we should distinguish between the death of the body the death of the person and so
forth details aside roughly speaking the following is true when
the body breaks I cease
to exist as
exist with a different
where we're at in terms of the metaphysics we
along the atomizer
the end should we be afraid of death I take it that. That's quite common but we can
simply is death bad as we typically take it to be
have to continue living without John John's death is bad for John's friends and family
this spaceship takes off at about
about the fact that your friend has died golf
course this is worse for me as somebody who cares about my friend that he's died but the
number one we couldn't communicate with him he couldn't communicate
with us if
it be true that
death is bad for the person that dies that's
the question we turn to next time
are bad for you are bad intrinsically their
bad by virtue of their very nature there's something
about the way they aren't you don't want those are bad in their own right but
bad it's not bad it's a pleasant enough way to spend a half an hour or
that better good there's
something bad
out two envelopes I say pick one and you
only good if it means to buy something what
can I get you to you the other envelope had $1,000 in it bad for
IWC fields on his Tombstone says personally I'd
that the deprivation account basically has it
despite the initial plausibility of the deprivation account have to give it
bad for me can't really be a fat all
a possible response to objection but of course it just immediately raises a further objection how could
bad would be exactly like that to lack something you don't need to exist indeed the very
fact that you don't exist might provide
crucial point about
deprivation you don't even need to so much as
exist in order to
be deprived of something non-existence guarantees that you're deprived of something so perhaps we should
just reject the existence requirement perhaps
is a possible person but never actually gets born but hard to think about somebody like
they would have sex and have a baby you know his
sperm join with her egg form a fertilized egg video the fertilized egg develops into
person could happen but won't happen could exist but won't exist now
never is born so he's
a scene in Homer I think we're we're some sort of sacrifices being
made and and all the dead Souls ghosts or hover around
longing to be alive again to discuss a birth of the food and
tastes and smells of Life potentially possible but never
lot how many well I once tried to
calculate well the calculation is utterly off the back of the
envelope sort of rough and and completely inadequate
in ways that all I'll point
out but at least it'll give you a sense of just how many potential people there
are let's start modestly and how many possible people could we the current
generation produce some years
of them are men half of them are women what we
want to know then it's how many possible people
could the two and a half billion then make all together with the two and a
tell me if it is if my parents had had sex 5 minutes
earlier 5 minutes later he's going to be some other sperm would have
joined with the egg that would have been not me being born but some
sibling being born instead of me change the egg change
sorry for every nearly possible person every person who could have been born
that never gets born and
number of possible people people who could have existed but will never exist the number
The Unborn possible people
is a moral tragedy that mirror that staggers the mind the worst possible moral horrors of
don't about you when I think about it all I can say is it doesn't strike me
as being a moral catastrophe I
death isn't bad for me which is really rather surprising I can
he doesn't even satisfy the modest existence requirement inshort with no
existence requirement we have to say the on existence of the billions and billions is bad that seems unacceptable
get into the club as we might put it of those creatures as possible creatures that
we care about
things worse and worse imagine that I caused them to die after 1 year we're still all this is
perfectly intuitive the shorter their
we didn't make things worse at all. We haven't done anything objectionable
it actually possible that some of you may have written your paper
on because it's the puzzle about Lucretia deposit lucretius gives
just like you'll be an infinite. After my
death in which I won't exist and realizing that fills us with just may it wasn't
got to be somewhere where
this one so nothing bad about this one maybe we should say instead
the deprivation account
we had existed then we be able
common response but I'm inclined to think that can't be an adequate answer it's true of course that
do we care more about not
have you there is it still me when you imagine me with an earlier would rather with living longer
necessary truth about me that I got hit by
an essential feature of you
fact that I was born in 1954 instead of 1944 and that's the
for the rest of you got to put a plug in your own birthdates Nagel says you can't do
it the date of my death is a contingent fact about me but the

comes up to me with a box of Godiva Chocolate offers me a couple of job isn't
the 21st piece of chocolate or the 50th piece of chocolate no longer good logically
still be a good thing. Let's ask
what should we
think about the prospect of living forever would in fact be better
and better and better somebody died at age 10 buy some horrible
changes that bodies undergo as they get older but instead
these creatures that live forever but their mind is gone and they're sort of in pain and they
that I invite you to participate in what kind
to say that immortality is bad is not to say it's a good thing
that we die when we do you can still believe consistency consistently that we die too soon David
Niven principal eventually sooner or later death would no longer be bad it could be that it comes too
soon for all

first question we want to discuss has to do with the possibility of my surviving
the nature of personal identity to get
obviously not the injection I
happens in the movie after the movie ends these are stupid question because once
about to tell you a story where I wish I knew the facts and I don't know the
The car will pass that results in death
may start differently but but I presume that they converge and
so here's the question then suppose we call that process death
that's the question that I'm going to turn to what
sure will I survive my data survive my
need to get clear about what what
exactly is it for something to be
a thing is a person it seems
think the two most prominent positions in definitely the ones most worth taking
seriously for our purposes stuff first possible position is this a person is a combination of a body
and something else a mind but the crucial thing
do you know, not work it's a soul so people are or people
of various kinds of molecules atoms and so forth. The body but
mind this dual
is Butte According to which the soul is something in material non-physical
some other kind of the body
certain kind of material object a person is just a body course it's a
very fancy material object
can be rational can communicate can make plans can fall in love can write poetry that's
mind two-way interaction with philosophy more complicated versions of dualism where
maybe the interaction doesn't work both ways but let's just limit ourselves.
Good old-fashioned two-way interactionist
Heights Mi my mind controls my body my body can affect
my mind and various ways but for all that they're separate things still there's this very tight connection and
we sometimes put at the soul is in the body though of course talking about spatial location here
when the body dies
Duelist view the belief in the soul gives you something to continue to exist after the
end of death well
person is the pair and pear no longer exist the person no longer exist so if
course my soul me I have a very tight connection to
death of the body
questions hang a WhatsApp those questions are ones that especially interest Play-Doh

the overall value of your life we can still say it's how good your life is a matter
question Gerry and
at it and berries in
whatever the details might be we could describe lines and say whether or not their
life was good as a whole the what
it's as though we've been assuming and I have been assuming
up to this moment that being alive per se has no value its life itself is a container which
the function of the contents the pleasure in
worth having there's if there's a benefit to me above and beyond the
life of somebody who can have an emotional side it's something
person per se is valuable note
and subtract the failures or add up all the knowledge and
subtract the
ignorance and deception doing
notice that since we were adding extra positive facts extra positive points for the fact that you're alive even
if the contents subtotal is negative the grand total could still be positive supposed to
the point of thinking about the possibility of accepting of valuable container theory is to remind us that
life is going in terms of its content is bad being alive per
se might still be a good thing how
contents are the grand
Fantastic valuable container Theory as opposed to the
modest valuable container Theory

if we see that our death is inevitable and we
sides in different moods
get pulled in both ways what about
rich inequalities morally objectionable than a very likely we're going to think it's more morally horrendous that there's this
crucial inequality some of us died at the age of 5 While others get to live to 90 but
amount of life that's exactly 50% of people get more than the
median amount of light is another person
who have less than the average of something it hurts
them more then it benefits the people who have more than average of something and
could imagine a world like this where we

think about while I still could have had good thing too soon and you didn't get where you
finking about these points in effect I'm suggesting that the value of your life that
God of the choice between these two lives I
The Narrative Arc as
all of this suggests then that the unpredictability of our death as an extra negative element it makes
know how much time you got left but then
would have you would you want to have that kind of
happened like that death is the possibility of
death is ubiquitous it's pervasive we have
of the fact that they introduce the risk of death that sounds rather bizarre at
shock you there are people who jump out of airplanes now when they
from the safety of your airplane part of the

have some risk of death it's got to be greater risk than usual if that's right
if that's the psychology they even for those death death thrill-seekers
the Badness of death so you might think well what about
value of that until your combination the most natural thing to suggest would be
we might be attracted to the
of the rest of the universe it's not
so much that immortality with the rest of them have is unattractive or boring it's perfectly fine but they
a bad ones there's two possibilities for that
the nature
to have been born
off on thinking about that question a bit
further before we get to Suicide a few weeks is how should one live in light of
the facts about death that I've been laying out
much think about them except them and act accordingly but simply don't think about them maybe
I'd just Jack Sanibel the facts about life and death are as I've
described them until we say something more it's not clear that we
fact it would just be overwhelming it would be crushing I'd be unable to go on with
my life people sometimes claim
that that's the case and because
the case if the things written down in the envelope
seems odd doesn't seem like it makes sense if there
hot day you love milkshakes and your
that if only we faced the fact about our mortality that we would live life rather differently how
to make at this point hose
always disregarding the facts about death might well be the appropriate response I'll
death that's the question we have to turn to next time
happens we behave it could be on the
built question I want to ask is how is it appropriate what ways
cryptic saying as is typical of of cough, but the suggestion I suppose is a fairly common one
first kind of behavior quote
appropriate response is appropriate ride that I
a proper in this condition what are the conditions under which is appropriate to be afraid of something
died look at you in a sort of an uncomprehending fashioned it
seem to be satisfied doesn't make sense to be proud we
does it make any
it make any sense this is cute little bunny right it's not dangerous and poisonous spiders are
not poisonous fear
that not logically impossible but again
a bad thing. The worst thing in the world it's a bad thing to have somebody
and that person's computer gets stolen you
could be angry you can be pissed you can be annoyed I can feel stupid that
you can take adequate precautions but when the ad appears what's
going to do it one more time no worse than before what
painful no one of the interesting interesting facts is that we could have course minimize or eliminate
the Pain by giving people adequate pain medication and silicones
of dead and with regard to that I
the positions about
doesn't make sense cuz it doesn't have the relevant degree of uncertainty you
to death if so
be clear about what it is
the facts about death are so overwhelming that
I'm terrified of death all I can say and
working through some
of these examples sometimes anger makes sense sometimes resentment makes sense that may
make sense so in having argue that for the most part fear of
argued that immortality would be bad the fact that you will die is
not actually bad it's good cuz it
seems you from the unpleasant aspects
of an eternal dreary Dreadful Immortal existence
they were doing
your make an agent if
when you're angry at them you are reviewing the fat that you think they mistreated you
miss treatment requires the notion of a behave toward you in a way that morally they shouldn't distract me
that take us
it that you think is the cause of our mortality we only
get are 50 or 80 years here's to crude
Alternatives even
God a kind of classic theistic conception of God According to which God is a person who makes decisions
about what to do and God has condemned to death that's
what happens in Genesis right God punishes Adam and Eve by making them die
all right that's picture number one picture number two is yet you
Universe the universe as though it was a person deliberately decided to make us die too soon however, in
swirling forming various kinds of combinations anger
going to get more but have that thought
ice cream it's extraordinary really lucky of us to be in this select fortunate few let
and just have a
were mortal we have only a limited. Of time in which to do the
we've got a very high chance of actually accomplishing strategy number two says that's
right mixture before a certain number
suggest that we most of us come remotely close
where we achieved great things rather than a shorter life where we achieved great things
care about quantity at all if he can accomplish something great if
that will continue this strikes me as a kind of desperate striving desperate reaching for
when I think about them unlike the
grander something significant something valuable about having made an accomplishment having achieved something that continues Beyond me
all the
bad to lose after up if we were to decide that life wasn't really a valuable gift if it
to fall right the central Badness of death is explained in the deprivation account you
it's loss is not a bad thing but a good thing the trick
then isn't to make life as valuable as a couldn't be but rather
to come to recognize that I'm balanced life isn't positive but negative to it
foremost example of this second outlook is expose Buddhism Four Noble
isn't good first Noble Truth life is suffering estimation
what Buddhist try to do is to free you from attachment to these Goods so that
For Better or For Worse I'm a child of the West I'm a child

and I suppose for most of us remain among the strategy strategies with which I began how is
it that we can most make our lives valuable what

it's a good thing that your life has continued but you see given the two State requirement we
have to say that had you died you would have been in some inferior state we
it would be bad saving it for you is benefiting you it's doing you a favor 2
we compare the the great life that lasts
a hundred years versus the
great life and only last 20 years because you
didn't save their life we say up the life of a hundred years better life and
implausible we should let it go now
but still we we
here we still have to go return to another issue that we've considered before namely is life
we had valuable container theories
According to which being alive is so valuable that
doesn't matter how bad the contents get total is
always a positive one now look if you
you were a person able to experience things no
things and
is that life or the life of a person
container fans
what are the contents are sufficiently good or bad or mix
they die and you look at these lives Mercedes Our Lives
to continue their lives
let's focus on some case
from being alive but of course if
live in a society which is
have the good part and bad part or better to have none of it and
horrible. Of your life and now it's over your
immobilize and in a great deal of pain while their nerves regenerate
their skin regraft in the like and early on in that. This person said although he
believed that he eventually recover why
my life is going to go on from here on out
then suicide would be rational but of course we never have a crystal ball we never
have the guarantee that this is how the lines going to go 2 question we need to turn
candy situations like that could it ever be reasonable to judge that your
situation is like that and if so could it ever then
we say if your thinking is clouded then
Jordan number one sure it's overwhelmingly likely that you're going to be tortured phone number
reasonable to throw that chance away and avoid the overwhelmingly likely
possibility that I'll continue in my current state with
a life not worth living seems to me that you're thinking clearly there
could be cases in which suicide would
you are in this kind of
going to have to have so much physical disability
but even here I'm not convinced let's again try to think of a case not quite like suicide and
to be swayed by the argument at this point that since you
ethics what we try to lay down a basic fundamental theory about morality all
will well unless you got an instruction manual you might think for example that no
a lot of assumptions behind that argument that we would need to really examine is there a god when
I was we need that waiting for the gods will argument expressed
prepared to obey this instruction manual you would have is a sentence in
inclined to do instruction
is someone does you a favor you owe them something bad attitude and so the argument might then
you kill yourself you're rejecting the gift that's being ungrateful and ingratitude is immoral drunk and that's why suicide
that somebody I'll call him the bully gives you a pie and says eat it that's
it in the pie that would seem like a rather odd thing to
to hear God just a bully on this story that's
not to say that I think God is a bully if you
believe plausible enough God is good in
God's not going to want you to continue eating the pie once it's spoiled James you
suggested that at least if we
thing this is the sort of thing that we've learned by
thinking about what does the Badness of death
is bad for them but in the kinds of cases that were
that we've been focused on the person is better off dead they're better off dead meaning that what
life now hold out for them although perhaps not negative through and through who
is negative on balance is negative on balance there not better off continuing to live
there better off dying and that means of course that dying isn't
what led to the conclusion that from the moral point to do as far as focusing on
just focus on
consequences for the person who's contemplating
get affected by the death or suicide of the of the person most obvious
if that's true we all have to ask how the consequences way out after all we we
live in a world in which no single act typically
that app or some food at even if there are then negative consequences
she'd be bet he or she would be better off dying what
the faith or what-have-you has brought it about that this
person's choices
are not reduced to killing himself on the one hand or continuing does
fact that these are the only choices they've got but still given the limited choices they made
position what conclusions would we come to then about
as a rather implausible empirical claim it's sadly enough not too
think of cases where your life is worse than nothing you'd be better
for the sake of your children so it
certain circumstances suicide will be morally Justified roughly speaking in
when we say consequences matter and
they're all that matters thought
other things were unsurprisingly this is a area than
to think it's wrong
to harm people or at least innocent people it's wrong to
harm innocent people even if the results I'm doing that might be good now I threw
in the qualification but innocent people because of
an example to end the class with a nice big bang right to
Z submachine gun I now take it and go Ratatat tat
killing 15
of you well that was not be
an innocent person has better results real
organs from the ones that have died to save
your choice roughly is this just give John his
5 gal of a jack and John's
seems what we have to say is suicide is wrong suicide is
morally unacceptable because when I kill myself I'm killing somebody and
is morally
results will really be better overall if he kills himself yeah that's right the right
results would be better 5 vs 1 wrong to kill
how I treat others it's not about how I treat myself and
killing while then suicide is acceptable
when start saying things about
it's wrong from the deontological perspective to
seemed highly relevant in thinking about the morality of suicide
right and even from the deontological perspective suicide may be morally legitimate carry out
the stand one
the patient has given you permission to operate on them
more fully developed deontological perspective we ought to say suicide is permissible at least
the principle of consent suppose we're talking after class and you say to me Shelly you've got my
John Smith but you're crazy you didn't kill John Smith is not even dead
that clearly isn't acceptable or
so if we start accepting this consent principal will into some pretty implausible conclusions throw it out maybe we
should really doesn't have the kind of power that a minute ago it
quick. It's going to blow up and it will kill my five
I will probably hurt very much
or throw myself on the hand grenade my body absorb the blow
few of us would
have it within ourselves to do
deontological right not to have innocent people be killed don't
talk about the results are better yeah of course by Buddy saved
results are better but that doesn't seem enough to us in our deontological mood after
all suppose that I see the hand grenade that's what I do is I take Jones and throw him
cases well who's not yet confident to make this sort of decision there's
there's room for disagreement
confidence but you don't have any
put it out of our mind we don't think about it even when it's staring
accept a
life and death life is
so incredible that under no circumstances could
virtually from start to finish there is
no soul we are just machines not just any
old machine we are amazing machines we are machines
capable of
loving capable of dreaming capable of
being creative capable of making plans and sharing them with
others we are people but we're just machines anyway and when the machine breaks that's the
end big mystery
which we can't get our heads around death is in
the recognition of just how incredibly lucky we
all are to have been alive at all at the same time recognizing that
sense of luck and being fortunate doesn't mean
I've been invited you to do over the course of the semester is not only
perhaps strictly speaking but we should say is the only part that the essential
to the person is the soul
goes got a rather intimate connection to a particular body that's the
so on now we might argue about what's the exact best list
of those abilities
for our purposes I think that won't be crucial and so I'll sometimes talk about this
you know chalk radios cars those things can't do all those abilities that makes something a person text
mental abilities of the body away we we we we we talked about
what is a smile will a smile is just a way of talking about
duelist that
well Smiles are these extra non-physical things you know that that have a special intimate
love talk of all of those things is what we mean by the mind but
that the
on the physical if you are
could on the physical point of you call those
talking about the dualist view so
question we want to turn to then is which of these two views should we believe the Duelist position
or the physicalist position and The crucial question presumably as
taste them so forth and so on that
I observe I believe it I don't see it
maybe not the only method but there is something
the rotation of the star the gravitational fluctuations what have
that we can think of so look why am
so it's a matter of influence not just any old explanation but inference to the best explanation we
explain better then the explanation that we would have if we had to limit ourselves to bodies map
there Mysteries or puzzles about
The crucial question of course has what's the relevant feature at is
there some feature that the physical is can't explain and so we need to appeal to
something extra physical to explain it or
we have reason to believe in the soul bike
need to appeal to the soul in order to to in order to explain these
of characteristics we might appeal to their might we might say one set
you'll think it over and you'll eventually come to agree with
was something non-material there got all the same Parts there but
object can
break and although we need to offer a story about what
moving purposefully something that
explain that's controlling the Motions of
program the robot or the missile so don't we need there to be something
outside the body that programs the body and that could be the sole that's
not just robots with some sort
of program in
our brain that were following we've
the art of the animation either soul to
talk about beliefs desires and reasoning and strategizing example we've
it's rational to this doing all
these things and yet we're not
really have believed so desires then it will follow that
when we are tempted to ascribe beliefs and desires to my
chest playing computer were falling
grounds is there for withholding descriptions of beliefs and desires to the
queen and crushing me you
let's distinguish let's say there's a way of
talking about beliefs and desires which is just going to be caption in terms of responding in
that's not a very compelling argument physical sale of that aspect
of the mental is pretty clear we can explain in physical
terms but
fans of souls paucity existence of souls so as to explain something that needs explaining about us. I
or transform or change or end up in the very same state determine ism
the argument somewhat more fully might be we have free
we're doing here is the most quick and superficial glance but
to be the case to prove that we've got a solo at least for this argument to work
to prove that we've got us all it's got to
don't have free will of course we mistakenly believe we've got free will
we are physical objects that labor under the illusion that we have free will but after all
we could have acted differently but maybe that's an illusion as I say
so although I don't like I don't believe the argument is sound from this
one doesn't happen to me the premise I myself
despite what money
many of us might have otherwise believe the fundamental
say well after all that was an 80% chance that it would take
true at the
determinism isn't true of us at the fundamental level and
with determinism so
the contrary notwithstanding have both determinism and Free Will their compatible and sis
if quantum mechanics was wrong and somehow you're at the macro level
it father in determinism whatever level
level we are deterministic
we are deterministic
systems so what if a deterministic system
could nonetheless have free will we could
explain our having free will it
or scientific grounds for worrying about each one of the premises the argument requires
thinking that those arguments are not compelling but notice that
above it eventually perhaps they
leave the operating room all
their bodies weren't in
heaven so something on bodily went to heaven that's how the explanation ghost unnatural straightforward explanation of what's
light on what it would be like to permanently move to France we say give me a break
attempts to dismiss the appeal to near-death experiences on what my call philosophical grounds
it's closing stretches some fairly unusual biological processes kick in in rare but
distance in physical terms we don't really have very much of a physical explanation until we begin
to offer scientific accounts of each of those aspects of near-death experience but
the person who's conducting the Seance knows things about your history that only your dead uncle would know
case you've got to decide for yourself what strikes you as the better explanation is the supernatural duelist explanation
the more likely one or is the physical is explanation the more likely one
you have a dream where your dead mother has come back to talk to you one possible
explanation to do list that's the ghost of your mother in material sold at she is communicating
may still be out but I don't think what
we should say is the better
probably said enough for you to grant that
that possibility the
is imagine that my mind exists but my body does not I was at show Descartes says
what I just did was imagine my mind existing without my body but how could I even do that
so here's podium try to tell a story in which this Podium exist but this
to follow that A & B are not the same thing because it be was just another
same point the other way around if I can
imagine a without the then A and B have to be logically distinct things they cannot be identical but
since I can imagine my mind existing without
my body it follows that
my mind and my body have to be logically distinct
things they cannot be identical my mind cannot just be a way of talking
talking about my mind cannot just be a way of talking about my body now
thing to be clear a couple things be clear about what exactly is this argument not doing the argument
is not saying if something is possible if I can imagine it it's true I
thinking by the attempts to show that the Mind must be
something separate from my body and what's what's amazing about
about my body then
so if you can I can I
to imagine a world in which somebody's smile exists but their body doesn't can't
Body that still visible as Dawn comes
in at against to get low as a first pass of the evening star is the first star visible
argument if a yard you meant if they're trying to run the Cartesian argument for astronomy fails yes
that they cars original argument doesn't work either
that's a silly thing to say about the astronomy case maybe that's the right diagnosis could we
similarly say I didn't
really imagine a world in which my mind exists but my body doesn't
wrong ever hand isn't imagination our best guide to logical possibility isn't the reason I think unicorns are
actual World they are separate maybe the argument goes wrong by assuming that identity
contingent Maybe he
are not identical to bodies
even though in other logically possible world the identity comes apart identities not
necessary but contingent as the Philosopher's put it not
interesting thing about Descartes argument is that it's easy to
see something God has gone wrong in the case of the morning star in the evening star but
we are considering in this class is an interactionist position
the soul does Socrates thinks this soul Fink's the soul
in its Essence is rational it takes care of God thinking side of things what
itself or beauty itself or goodness it cell or Hell itself to
all sorts of beautiful objects in the World objects can vary in terms of how beautiful they are
being round the mind can think about perfect circularity no physical
object is perfectly circular there only things that are circular to a greater or lesser degree so by thinking
is to disregard the body put it aside separate his mind as
much as possible from it that's
what Socrates says
seems like a very compelling account of what's
going on in mathematics what
that conclusion for that position and starting next time it will work out way through those arguments
essential aspects about Play-Dohs metaphysical use the key Point behind is metaphysics then was the thought that
that distinguishes the empirical World from this sort of this realm of platonic ideal objects is
between one form in the other and and it's hard to make sense of in contrast
to try to argue for or against platonism with regard to abstract entities
were distracted from thinking about them by the by the distractions provided
by the body the desire for food drink Sex what have you sleep but
life if you're too enmeshed in its concerns then
upon the death of your body your soul gets sucked back in reincarnated perhaps in another body if
know in a in a scientific way but we can we can glimpse and
reconstruct my time
some of the later arguments seem to be deliberately aimed at answering objections that we can raise
systematic fashion Plato's worked out axiomatic news about
the nature of philosophy it couldn't it could be that played as
just act as though they
is normally the case for our readings I'm going to actually periodically look
at my notes and make sure I'm remembering how I think they don't understand the
arguments since the dialogue is indeed a dialogue we don't always have the arguments laid
is this picture we're
natural warming to have maybe what
the ideas or the forms Justice itself Beauty itself goodness itself the forms are not physical objects
something non-physical namely the soul I think
that the sketch of where Socrates wants
to go it doesn't quite give us what we want on the one hand
one I want to focus on and
that the soul must be non-physical so the
physical is view is wrong and the Soul must be Eternal Soul is immortal
physical passing
what do they exist or not but just for a brief period an HTC
objects cannot obtain cannot grasp can
I have knowledge of the attorney changeless non-physical forms in pure cannot obtain the pure that's
needs Bill all I can say is why should we believe 2 why
should we think there's
we're dealing with platonic forms give us some reason to believe premise to
the first argument Play-Doh Madewell recognize
the inadequacy of that argument because after
all Socrates goes on to offer a series of other arguments dogs turn the next I
steering wheel hence the name that gave the argument the argument from recycling that's the
nature of soda reality completo things and come into
being by being composed of
previously existing parts and then when those things seems to have that form they
had the parts get used for other purposes they get recycled if
continue to exist after my death but
that doesn't mean that every part of my body existed before I
seems wrong don't
stages of the argument because
sometimes the best way to understand a later argument is to see it as responding to
the weaknesses of earlier argument pretty clearly
very next argument attempts to persuade us that indeed
we do have reason to believe that the soul is one of the prior existing pieces and
the what's the what's the crucial fact to remember
the one hand temporal sequence first you know Ruth give
me truth you get to know Ruth then at
you and suddenly you're remembering things
you know about Ruth that's how
bump up against we look at we have interactions with these everyday objects and somehow they get
this life that's Plato's argument Plato says thinking about
we had no good reason to think the soul was one of
our body got put together before I before I
that in order to explain how it is we could have knowledge of the forms
now that we have
push straight ahead to the idea of the perfectly straight even if I never have encountered it before mystop
for the very first time that's a question that's injection that will turn to it start of next class
and roundness we have to grasp the forms but it couldn't be
Heavenly platonic realm I don't mean literally
up words not as though these things at
the number three is up there but if
you accept the metaphor running into things
envisions to Socrates disciple Sidious and CDs responded by saying even if
the soul existed before birth it doesn't follow that it exists after
back to the parts all right so the
prior Parts get recycled the
before are going to exist afterwards it must follow that if it still existed before
exist forever engines will eventually decompose and turn back into atoms tell
engine can't itself be destroyed can't itself decompose can't fall apart
that's what we need if we're really going to become convinced of the immortality of the Soul is
from another can destroy the piece of paper I take its parts apart this
generalizations things that
changeless they're simple and simple things can't be destroyed forms can't be destroyed you
put all this together Socrates are symbols and
to immortality and
I got too many coats in my life for all that I'm not indestructible if
voice of cities but Socrates on Plato's behalf never answers the objection how to say
Elise hunt
rather entitled to the Bone or conclusion the soul can be destroyed.. End of the discussion so
despite the fact that Socrates draws this week or conclusion it seems to
me that the argument he's offered us if it works at all entitles us to draw
and if that's true then of course we no longer have an argument for the indestructibility or
near indestructibility of the Soul because
wrong that you can destroy Harmony also there is the HARP making its melodious harmonia harmonia sounds and
on which it depends of
the Soul by destroying the body on which the Mind depends so
the crucial point right now is that thinking about Harmony is offered as a
counterexample to
the generalization that invisible things can't be destroyed Harmony's invisible Harmony can be destroyed so
invisible things can be destroyed so you're wrong Socrates when you say visible things can't be
good criticisms or not but
to say you know what the mind isn't very much like Harmony at all that analogy really stinks so
what all that simeus needs to cause problems for Socrates argument is the claim that
Harmony is invisible and Harmony can be destroyed as long as that is true we
invisible if he
proceed as it was before that's
what Socrates shooting gun he should have said you
know what Harmony is not really invisible or can't be destroyed but
it's not a whiff of that at least in the
dialogue as we got it not a whiff of that as far as I can see
am going to take some time to think about whether or not Harmony is a good analogy because
I actually think it is a good
analogy I think what's going on in the
harmony harmony as
always the harmony of the body is an early attempt
it's functioning properly when it's well-tuned sold off the harmony analogy is
same way that well for example
Harmony is dependent upon the physical
instrument so I think it's a very nice attempt to
discuss the physicalist alternative to Plato's dualism and that's
it's going to follow that we can't conclude from the invisibility the soul if
the soul cannot be destroyed so
be destroyed what Socrates means
by invisibility is
by invisible maybe instead
can only be grasped by
the reasoning power of the mind they are not seen but are invisible so
I think it's pretty clear that when Socrates I was talking about with visible vs Invisible
that doesn't mean that we should still accept the argument because there might
be a different counterexample tears my proposal supposed to
take not about Harmony but radio waves radio waves are not sensible they
okay send a suggestion
is it invisible in the way that radio waves are destructible know my point is
not to say oh you idiot Play-Doh why didn't you think of radio waves are question is
not was Plato
overlooking something he should have thought
a counterexample now that we interpret the relevant notion of invisibility is undetectability so couldn't Play-Doh continue to
claim things that are fully invisible meaning undetectable those things can't be destroyed radio waves
by visibility we mean can't be detected is it true that the soul can't be detected I
sounds if you hook a soul up to a body you can
tell the soul is there by what does salt by what the body is doing discussing philosophy with you
you detect the presence of your friend's Soul through its effect on your friend's body but
doesn't have part is because it's invisible cuz it was all things cannot parts
